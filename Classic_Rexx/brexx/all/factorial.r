         and real (C double precision numbers). It's better
         to use a real number ie 45.0 instead of 45 for large
         factorials since the later will result to a factorial using
	 integer arithmetic resulting in a crazy result
         (15 is the largest integer factorial that can be calculated
          with out any error )
