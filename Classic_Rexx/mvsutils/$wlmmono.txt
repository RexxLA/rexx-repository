               Setting up WLM in a MONOPLEX                                     
                                                                                
 Recommendations:                                                               
                                                                                
 You may want to start from scratch as opposed to trying to "convert"           
 your IPS/ICS.  A good place for an example of a service policy can             
 be found at Cheryl Watson's web site:

 Here are a few manuals to review for setting up a monplex with WLM:            
                                                                                
        MVS Settings up a Sysplex                                               
        Parallel Sysplex Hardware and Software Migration                        
          (pay attention to steps for defining WLM Data Sets                    
           and Policys)                                                         
        Planning: Workload Management                                           
                                                                                
 -------------------------------------------------------------------            
                                                                                
 Implementation Specifics:                                                      
                                                                                
 1) Define XCF couple datasets with the IXCL1DSU utility                        
    - see SYS1.SAMPLIB(IXCSYSPF)                                                
                                                                                
 2) Create COUPLExx member with data set names and sysplex name.                
                                                                                
 3) Update IEASYSxx with PLEXCFG=MONOPLEX,COUPLE=xx                             
                                                                                
 4) IPL                                                                         
                                                                                
 5) Define WLM couple datasets.                                                 
    - see SYS1.SAMPLIB(IWMFTCDS)                                                
       The WLM dialogs can also be used:                                        
       TSO EX 'SYS1.SBLSCLI0(IWMARIN0)'                                         
       Select UTILITES >> Allocate WLM couple datasets                          
                                                                                
 6) Use operator command to add the WLM couple datasets:                        
     SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=WLM,PCOUPLE=(data.set.name)                             
     SETXCF COUPLE,TYPE=WLM,ACOUPLE=(data.set.name)                             
   *** be sure to update your COUPLExx member with the WLM                      
       couple data sets.                                                        
                                                                                
 7) Now the fun part - create the service definition policy                     
    via the WLM dialogs (you need security access to the                        
    FACILITY CLASS resource name of MVSADMIN.WLM.POLICY)                        
                                                                                
 8) Store the policy via WLM Dialogs                                            
                                                                                
 9) V WLM,POLICY=polname                                                        
                                                                                
 10) F WLM,MODE=GOAL  (to switch back - F WLM,MODE=COMPAT)                      
                                                                                
 To IPL in goal mode - remove IPS=xx & ICS=xx from IEASYSxx.
