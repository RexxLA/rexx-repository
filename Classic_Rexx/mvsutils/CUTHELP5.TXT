        The use of the operands ADD, REPLACE, ZERO, and KEEP define
        the mode for the CUT and PASTE macros.  The most common
        mode could be called the "gather mode" with operands ADD
        and ZERO.  This is where several groups of lines are
        gathered from here and there and finally pasted into one
        member.   The other mode could be called the "distribution
        mode" where one group of lines is CUT and then placed in
        several members or in several spots in one member.  This
        uses the operands REPLACE and KEEP.  The defaults can be
        set for the mode you like most.   Ether mode works when
        working in the "one for one mode" where each CUT is
        followed by one PASTE.  If you set the defaults to ADD
        and KEEP you will have to keep track when to override
        with ether REPLACE or ZERO or you will accumulate lines.
