        The CUT and PASTE Edit macros provides a handy method
        to move data from one Edit session to another. The CUT
        macro saves lines from a Edit session. The PASTE macro
        place these lines into another Edit session (or the
        same session).  The CUT macro can combine lines with
        previous saved lines.  The PASTE macro can place these
        lines into one or more Edit session.   The Edit sessions
        can be on different screens and/or Edit sessions started
        at a latter time provide you do not exit ISPF
