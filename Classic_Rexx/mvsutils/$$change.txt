12/13/2007 - Updated LPROG to add the IEASYSxx LNKAUTH setting                  
             (either LNKLST or APFTAB) to the LNKLST display heading.           
12/04/2007 - Fixed REXX NOVALUE condition in IPLINFO RDATE subroutine.          
             Also made the same change to RDATE and RDATEF even though          
             SIGNAL ON NOVALUE is not used in those versions.                   
11/28/2007 - Updated CLONERES job and added old version as CLONERSO.            
11/12/2007 - Updated IPLINFO for z/OS 1.9 JES2 node offset and JES3             
             FMID. Also added the IEASYSxx LNKAUTH setting (either              
             LNKLST or APFTAB) to the LNKLST display heading.                   
10/09/2007 - Added error traps for SYNTAX and NOVALUE conditions                
             to IPLINFO.                                                        
10/09/2007 - Updated the following execs that use ISPF panels to                
             use ISPF services to create temporary ISPPLIB PDS                  
             members instead of REXX EXECIO: APVFER, CATSRCH,                   
             FINDMOD, IPLINFO, LPROG, REXXMEM and RXSTOR64.                     
08/27/2007 - Fixed an error in RXSTOR64 for displaying shared memory            
             objects. RAXLVSHRNMOMB was coded for a length of 4 when            
             it should have been a length of 8.                                 
08/23/2007 - Added a check to SW to prevent usage when EDIT/VIEW is             
             using the EDIF/VIIF interface.                                     
08/23/2007 - Made a cosmetic change to the "FIND_LABELS" code in the            
             following edit macros:                                             
             COLADD COLUTIL INSLINE PREFIX PREFIX2 SUFFIX                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
 CBT474  August 2007                                                            
                                                                                
05/31/2007 - Added CEC MSU, image MSU and 4 hour MSU average usage              
             to the IPLINFO CPU section and a display to show when              
             the LPAR is being "soft capped".  Also re-added the                
             code to create the ISPPLIB as a pemanent data set for              
             systems below OS/390 2.10.                                         
05/24/2007 - Added the ONEPAKZ8/TWOPAKZ8 jobs. These are updates to             
             the ONEPAKZ6/TWOPAKZ6 jobs and can be used to create a             
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 1.7 or z/OS 1.8 driving                
             system.                                                            
05/07/2007 - Updated INSLINE so it works with strings that contain              
             an ampersand.                                                      
05/01/2007 - Changed the following edit macros so they allow the                
             usage of system lables .ZFIRST/.ZF and .ZLAST/.ZL:                 
             COLADD COLUTIL FILL INSLINE PREFIX PREFIX2 SUFFIX                  
04/27/2007 - Added a display of the LOADPARM device address to the              
             IPA section of IPLINFO.                                            
04/27/2007 - Added new EXECs TSOV and TSOR (similar to TSOE/TSOB).              
             TSOR uses the REVIEW command from CBT file 134 or 135              
             and can be used under native TSO without ISPF. Also                
             updated the ISPCMDSA sample which adds these commands              
             to the ISPF command table.                                         
03/23/2007 - IPLINFO updates:                                                   
             1) Added z/OS 1.8 JES2 node offset and added the JES3              
                FMID to the FMID table for z/OS 1.8 JES3.                       
             2) Added a display to show the current status of catalog           
                SYS%-SYS1 conversion and current alias level.                   
             3) Added a customizable date format option. The default            
                option is to now use ISO 8601 format.                           
03/20/2007 - Fixed ISPCMDSA CLIST to work on current ISPF releases.             
             I'm not sure when it broke. Added one line of code.                
03/09/2007 - Updated the following execs that use ISPF panels to                
             create a temporary data set for ISPPLIB instead of a               
             permanent data set: APVFER, CATSRCH, FINDMOD, IPLINFO,             
             LPROG, REXXMEM and RXSTOR64.                                       
02/16/2007 - Updated INCL, EXCL, DELX, and DELNX so they can work               
             with strings that contain an ampersand.                            
01/23/2007 - Added the CMD34 rexx exec.  This exec an be used to                
             issue commands against an ISPF 3.4 type DSLIST.

             1) Added the ability to abbreviate all options to 3 or             
                more characters. An error message is now displayed              
                if an invalid option is used instead of defaulting              
                to the "ALL" option.                                            
             2) Added a display for the master catalog alias level,             
                the catalog type and SYS% conversion status.                    
             3) Added a display for the local time offset from GMT.             
             4) Add displays to the CPU section for maximum number              
                of CPUs and the number of GPs / zAAPs / zIIPs online            
                at IPL time.                                                    
             5) Restructured code to use CVT bits to determine OS               
                levels instead of FMIDNUM or PRODNAME.                          
             6) Added SYSNAME/GRSNAME to banner at top of displays.             
             7) Added new LPA, LNKLST and APF display options.                  
             8) Increased the number of variables that can be                   
                returned from 10 to 20 when IPLINFO is called as                
                a REXX function.

07/08/2005 - Added the CLONERES job. This is a sample jobstream                 
             to clone a two volume sysres set and SMP/E target                  
             zones.                                                             
06/23/2005 - Added the SMPDELF job.  This is a sample job to remove

             2) Added REXX function support (see source for details).           
             3) Added "(WLM)" to IRD/WLM managed CPUs in CPU display.           
             4) Added check for CVTVERID (user software version) and            
                display it in the version section if present.                   
             5) Support for greater than 16 CPs with z/OS 1.6 and               
                above. CPU number is now displayed in hex and also              
                as 2 digits on z/OS 1.6 and above (similar to the               
                D M=CPU operator command).

             Also copied updated RDATE version into IPLINFO, RACFUDEL,          
             and TAPESTAK.                                                      
05/09/2005 - Added the ONEPAKZ6/TWOPAKZ6 jobs. These are updates to             
             the ONEPAKZ3/TWOPAKZ3 jobs and can be used to create a             
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 1.6 driving system.                    
04/28/2005 - IPLINFO updates:                                                   
             1) Added display in CPU section to indicate a zAAP engine          
                and changed the MIPS calculation to not include zAAP            
                engines.                                                        
             2) Changed the system ID display message to indicate that          
             the GRS system id is the SYSNAME and the SMF system ID             
             is the SID.                                                        
04/01/2005 - Fixed bug in DELDUPS2 when trying to work with columns             
             that don't span the entire record.                                 
02/14/2005 - Added new XDSLIST REXX exec (command).  Also updated               
             the ISPCMDSA sample.                                               
02/14/2005 - XEF Changes:  Added an additional sample invocation REXX           
             exec for XEF that uses LIBDEFs called XEFLIBD. Removed             
             obsolete code from the )INIT section of XEFMENU.  Also             
             provided an alternate menu panel - XEFMENUB - for XEF 6.3          
             that can be used on any OS/390 system below OS/390 2.10            
             or MVS/ESA V5 (ISPF 4.2 or above is required).  However,           
             no verification is done for valid data set names or                
             patterns when adding the names to the XEF main menu.

02/10/2005 - Added a DSLIST option to XEF with support for data set             
             name patterns. The version has been changed from 6.2 to            
             6.3 and OS/390 2.10 (ISPF V5) or above is now required.            
             XEF 6.2 is still available in TSO XMIT format as member            
             XEFV62.

             2) Remove any ILM parms from IPA display for z/OS 1.5.             
             3) Fix HMC LPAR number code in IPL section when CPU(0) is          
                offline (broke when code was changed for z990).                 
             4) Change VMAP to show storage from "the top down" instead         
                of from "the bottom up". An option is given to show             
                it the old way (for now) if desired. See the comments           
                in the source code.

01/08/2003 - Fixed bad comment in REXXSCAN (sample JCL had a "/*" in            
             it so a second "*/" was needed in the comment).                    
01/02/2003 - Added the ONEPAKZ3 job. This is a sample jobstream to              
             build a one pack "rescue" system from a z/OS 1.3                   
             driving system.

             2) Sort the IPA parms. Had to add a sort subroutine                
                and re-write the code that splits up page data                  
                set names to multiple lines.                                    
             3) Removed "This was system number ?? added to the                 
                sysplex" message for a LOCAL sysplex.                           
           - Updated APFVER to show the system name and time of
