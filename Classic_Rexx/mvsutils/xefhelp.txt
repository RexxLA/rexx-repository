+ It allows you to choose a dataset from a menu instead of typing in the entire 
+ dataset name. If a dataset is not listed on the menu, you may still select it 
+ by using the%"OTHER DATASET NAME"+field.

+ XEF can also be used to obtain%DATASET INFORMATION+or display a%DATASET       
+%MEMBER LIST+of a partitioned dataset. From the member list you can select     
+ members to be BROWSEd, VIEWed, EDITed, DELETEd, RENAMEd, or PRINTed.          
+ Using the%DSLIST+option, a dataset pattern can be entered to display          
+ a Data Set List that is like ISPF option 3.4.  If the CBT%PDS+command         
+ is installed, XEF can also interface with it.

+ To start you must add datasets to the menu. To do this, simply tab to one of  
+ the dataset name fields (1 thru 99) and type in the dataset name that you wish
+ to have in that field (do not use quotes). The dataset must be cataloged, but 
+ the system will not check to see that it is until you try and access it.      
+ You can scroll through the dataset list using the UP and DOWN scroll commands.
