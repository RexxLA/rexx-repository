 EDIT Macros:                                                                   
   Copy the macro to any library in the SYSPROC concatenation.                  
   If the macro is a REXX, it can also be placed in any library                 
   in the SYSEXEC concatenation.                                                
                                                                                
 REXX EXECs/CLISTs:                                                             
   Copy the EXEC or CLIST to any library in the SYSPROC concatenation.          
   REXX programs can also be placed in any library in the SYSEXEC               
   concatenation.                                                               
                                                                                
   Many of the REXX EXECs and CLISTS are best used when set up as ISPF          
   commands. The ISPCMDSA CLIST is an example of how to add these               
   commands on a temporary basis without actually modifying the ISPF            
   Command Table (ISPCMDS). This also allows you to create aliases or           
   command abbbreviations without renaming the CLIST/EXEC.                      
                                                                                
 eXtended Editor Facility (XEF):                                                
   XEF is an ISPF dialog application that is used for BROWSING,                 
   VIEWING, EDITING, or COMPRESSING a dataset. It allows you to                 
   choose a dataset from a menu instead of typing in the entire dataset         
   name. XEF can also be used to obtain DATASET INFORMATION or                  
   display a DATASET MEMBER LIST of a partitioned dataset. From the             
   member list you can select members to be BROWSEd, VIEWed, EDITed,            
   DELETEd, RENAMEd, or PRINTed.  Using the DSLIST option, a dataset            
   pattern can be entered to display a Data Set List that is like ISPF          
   option 3.4.  If the CBT PDS command is installed, XEF can also               
   interface with it.                                                           
                                                                                
   XEF is invoked by selecting the main menu panel - XEFMENU. It can be         
   added to an existing ISPF option panel or is best used when set up as a      
   command in the ISPF Command Table (ISPCMDS). The ISPCMDSA                    
   CLIST in this PDS has an example of how to add the XEF command on a          
   temporary basis without actually modifying the ISPF Command Table.

   Add the following CLISTs to a library in the SYSPROC concatenation:          
      XEFCLIST - XEF mainline code                                              
      XEF      - REXX EXEC to invoke XEF (optional if using ISPF command        
                                          tables or an option menu to           
                                          invoke XEF)                           
      XEFLIBD  - Same as XEF CLIST but uses LIBDEFs (optional)                  
                                                                                
   Add the following panels to a library in the ISPPLIB concatenation:          
      XEFMENU  - XEF Main Menu                                                  
   ** XEFMENUB - Alternate XEF Main Menu (for systems below OS/390 2.10)        
      XEFHELP  - XEF Help Panel #1                                              
      XEFHELP2 - XEF Help Panel #2                                              
      XEFHELP3 - XEF Help Panel #3                                              
      XEFHELP4 - XEF Help Panel #4                                              
      XEFINF   - XEF Dataset Info Panel (SEQ)                                   
      XEFINFD  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDS)                                   
      XEFINFE  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDSE)                                  
      XEFINFP  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDS SMS)                               
      XEFINFS  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (SEQ SMS)                               
                                                                                
   Add the following messages to a library in the ISPMLIB concatenation:        
      XEF00    - XEF Messages                                                   
                                                                                
   ** Note: If you want to run XEF 6.3 on systems below OS/390 2.10             
      use the XEFMENUB panel instead of XEFMENU.  You should rename the         
      panel to XEFMENU during installation.  XEF 6.3 will function as           
      it would on systems running OS/390 2.10 or higher, however, no            
      verification is done for valid data set names or patterns when            
      adding the names to the XEF main menu.  This should work on any           
      OS/390 system below OS/390 2.10 or MVS/ESA V5 systems (ISPF 4.2           
      or above is required).                                                    
                                                                                
 =======================================================================        
                                                                                
 Sample ISPF Commands, Command Usage, and Edit Macro Usage                      
                                                                                
 The commands are activated by updating the ISPF Command table.  The            
 abbreviations for commands and edit macros are achieved by using the           
 command table or by renaming EXECs/CLISTSs.  The ISPCMDSA CLIST is an          
 example of how to add these commands on a temporary basis without              
 actually modifying the ISPF Command Table (ISPCMDS).
