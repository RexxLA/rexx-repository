Arithmetic is not easy to test because the Standard has (with Mike Cowlishaw's blessing) made the rules for default representation of numbers as character strings 
different from the original specifications.


There is a lot of data (like J18AR200.DAT) showing what results should be under the original rules. (Thanks to Walter Pachl and colleagues, I believe).


(OTT.CMD seems to show CRX failing FUZZ test, for me) 

The original intent of ARITHOP.CMD and ANSIBIFS.CMD was to run the code from the emerging Standard under a trusted (not CRX) Rexx interpreter, so as to debug the 
code in the Standard.  Eventually they may have been run under CRX it is not clear in 2011 how to do that.

The data is part of a big file of examples of what should happen in
arithmetic.  (Big file made by Vienna folk)
J18Bild2 reads that line by line and checks whether the code from the
Standard give the same result. (When run as rexx code by CRXD).  So
more a test of the Standard than a test of CRX.)

Dec 1999.  Making CRX do the J18Bilda that Warp does.

j18bild2.cmd works on just first 200 of data. Included arith, not external.
  April 2000 J18ar200 default data - OK.
j18bilda.cmd works on just first 200 of data. Uses externals.
