 Some stuff about speed.
 See \a\s\perf*.* for "C" versions.

 REXXCPS.CMD is .CMD so as to suit Warp.  It is 30000 x 1000 cluases executed.
 REXXCPS.RX is the same.
 REXXCPST.RX is the same but 3000 x 1000.
 OBJTRACE.LOG shows Warp trace of what happens in REXXCPS.
 Perf.rx and Perf.cmd are the same - primitives in Rexx.
 200.log shows the answers on a 200MHz machine.
 Perf30.rx is adjusted because Personal Rexx wouldn't run Perf.rx
