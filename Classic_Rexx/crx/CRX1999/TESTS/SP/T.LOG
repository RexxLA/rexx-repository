About 13 mega Rexx-Clauses-Per-Second on my 200MHz Pentium Pro.
Rough equivalent 'C', while(j--), is 2.5 times faster compiled for Dos
Object Rexx on Warp is about xxx MegaCPS.

You might think adding a NOP in the loop would tell us how long NOP takes.

12.690000
But the total time much more than doubles on my machine.
NOP has less work to do than ITERATE, so how come?
Presumably the smaller loop takes more advantage of hardware cacheing.
Suppose we make the an outer loop 20 and use 9 NOP's, getting 20 million
executions of ITERATE plus 180 million of NOP. (Versus 100 plus 100)
6.860000
That is quicker, reflecting that NOPs really are cheaper than ITERATEs.
The lesson is that only rough measurement meaningful, about 10 MegaCPS
for the minimal clause.
An assignment implies noticeably more data access and movement.
Here are 10 million assigns of a constant.
2.200000
Here are 10 million assigns of a variable.
1.920000
j = 1 to ten million involves assignment to j.
3.410000
Here are 10 million integer additions.
