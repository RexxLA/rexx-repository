The CRX project was worked on in spasms over a period of years and the documents here record that.  Although they are generally helpful (Guide.doc, Makefile) they have parts that were plans and design ideas that were eventually decided against.  So they cannot be relied on for detail - better to read the code itself.

There are more of these sort of notes in the archives, particularly w.r.t. the parsing methods, but I don't see a use for them here.

Instrum.doc is the result of some instrumentation of an execution - it shows the counts for various operations of pseudocode.
