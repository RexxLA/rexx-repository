June 92, about to do some C programming.  Thought I'd make another pass
over maximising the use of the PE2 editor that I'm used to.

So I need some little BATs to set the right profiles into E:

EC to set the editor for C

There are various levels of 'includes' used in such C programs.
\PRO\S for those of wide applicability.

Collected the materials for a parser generator - see HBNF.TXT

June 10 1992 - Simplify working.
June 18 1992 - Simplify really working!
Aug 2 1992 - Starters part of States working.
Aug 9 1992 - States developer working, on C grammar.
Sep 6 1992 - States has proved most useful for ANSI.  Starting a REGEXP for
             regular expressions.
Sept 25 1992 - Adding some options to make States neater.
Nov 15 1992 - Moved to Zenon. REGEXP is done.  MKs are SIMPLIFY STATES
REGEXP ENCODE TIDY
Nov 28 1992 - TIDY can do tokenizing based on the output of REGEXP and
ENCODE.  Now start STRUCTS to make 'C' structures encoding STATES output.
Dec 1992 - Made good progress making and using STRUCTS.
Mar 1993 - Back to it to pick up on problem of using the keyword tables
at the correct point in parsing.
     Got formatting to work, with flaws.
Aug 1993 Pushing Meet10 syntax through. Recap Simplify /:= x.bnf x.sim > x.val;
  States /# x.sim x.sta; Structs x.sim x.sta x.c; Edit ti.c for #defines with
  values from x.val;copy x.c tables.c;nmake tidy.mk;tidy t.cmd t.a;
  Must have got Msgc working here sometime.
Dec 93 Try again with Meet 11 syntax.
Jan 94 Try again with Meet 12 syntax.
Must fix - error at state 59 will give missing 'end' msg when Msg35 wanted.
Notes from library book. \a is a bell  /Fc for mixed asm list
April 94 - rework with M13/M14 syntax, new keyword rules.
May 94 - rework with M14A. Nowadays need to get M14A.C onto TABLES.C before
MSGC making M14A.cmp for msgc.cmp which goes into tidy.
July 94 - Syntax test cases OK now.
Sept 94 - rework Arith and Parse, test.
Oct 94 - After meet 14, rebuild.
  Note Filter.Rex will abstract Msgs from .STA
Aug 95 - restart, trying with approved standard.  Looks like some Msg35
conflicts as well as the IF ELSE conflict but perhaps doesn't matter.
Wont match with values used in ti.c unless comparison operators separated.
KEYNUM is an unsuccessful effort to get a algorithm to hash the verbs
directly to a number range.
FORM & FLAY seem to be pretty-print things now obsolete.
LIB is to do with Assembler.
SRNEW is a variation of STRUCTS for packed but it makes nul for my m16 now.
SRPK doesn't make sense - it includes srnew.c
Looks like STRUCTS was kept so as TIDY remained viable; SRNEW is going to
make smaller tables but we don't have an engine for those.
Start AOE.DOC for an account of table making.
Dec 95 - Can't find the main plan joining TODO.DOC DESIGN.DOC AOE.DOC etc.
Start a MAINPLAN.DOC
Some progress with Keynum, constructing a hash. Also HASHING prog.  But
actually binary search may be better.
Msgc x.msg x.cmp; copy x.cmp cmp.c for tidy.mk
Tidy x.rex x.ana > x.out
Remember Tidy uses cmp.c.  Hence tidy on Msgs.rex
Got some exits going.  Start new stage of SAMES for same states.
Jan96 Assembler infrastructure and msg unpacking.
Feb96 Msgs going, some tokenizing through J18ALL.
May96 32 bit versions of STRUCTS and PACK.
Aug96 Structs (run on Warp) run once is /a, once without, to make is.kwa
      and is.kwc which are copied to c:\h\s\keys.inc for assembly and to
      c:\h\s\tables.c for inclusion in MSGC. KEYS.INC needs hand labelling.
Oct96 Assembler running under OS/2 DOS box so stuff moved to D:
Mar97 WARP4 and new machine makes it F: and C: that are relevant.
Dec97 Pcode made.
Oct 98 Restart on Dell portable.  Never got MASM61 to work in OS2 DOS
box so work will be in multiboot mode - Warp for 32 bit utility
programs in 'C' and MS DOS for assemblys.
Mar 99 recap. A variation in crx.inc means crx.exe made in version tailored
to making special Pcode from CRX.RX (which is Rexx code from the standard.)
(CRXB.EXE)
The D.T that results is processed by BF.EXE (see D:\h\s\bf.mk) to produce
BF.T (and other info on its sysout).  BF.T, when copied back to C:\h\s,
is processed by ALL2INC to make the yyy.inc files that are Bcode for the
various builtins.
Jun 2002 Put into one MAKEFILE.  Some names above change.
