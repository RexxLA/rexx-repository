All these are talks, or notes for talks, by Brian Marks for Rexx symposia.

CRX.DOC is the earliest introduction to CRX.
CRXP has detail about the representation of Rexx values, and speed.  1998(?)
CRX9B was for the 1999 symposium.
CRX00.DOC is about how a tool can chop a program written in assembler into tiny pieces and rearrange the order of the pieces, taking into account numbers
from the instrumentation of the program's execution, to produce some 10% speedup. (On Pentium architecture).
CRXE.DOC and CRXF.DOC are short.
CRXFOIL.DOC is just the foils for some talk.
CRX9F.DOC is another set of bullet points and inserts for some talk.
CRX9.DOC Does not say much about CRX.
StandardHist.doc is much more recent and is only notes - more on the Standard than on CRX.

The symposium papers describe speeding up CRX by mechanically re-ordering the fragments of code to exploit Intel branch-prediction.  The code to do that
has not been included in this package since it has nothing to do with the Rexx Standard.
