# Unicode - Expected results in different Rexx dialects.

From a same [source file](https://github.com/RexxLA/rexx-repository/blob/master/ARB/standards/work-in-progress/code/expected_results/expected_results.rex),
several dialect source files are generated by the make command.

Tested under macOS.  
No makefile for Windows (yet).
