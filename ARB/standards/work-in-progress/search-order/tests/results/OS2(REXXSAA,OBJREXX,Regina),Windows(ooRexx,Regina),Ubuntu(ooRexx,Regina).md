That's a work-in-progress, still editing this file -- Josep Maria Blasco

The test program is distributed as a zip file implementing the structure shown below. The test initiator program, `sotest.rex`, calls immediately `./subdir/dotdotsame/same/same.rex`, to be able to set the "same" (or caller) directory in a convenient place. This has to be done manually, by patching the value returned from `Parse Source`, since we can not know whether a filename of the form `".\"` will work or not for a call (that's one of the things we are trying to find out in our test).

Similarly, we save and modify the current directory (by using the `Directory()` BIF) so that it is `./subdir/dotdotcurr/curr`, and we save and modify the value of the `PATH` variable so that it has a single directory, `./subdir/dotdotpath/path`.

This directory structure and this setting of the caller's, current and path directories allow us to thoroughly test many variations of the `Call`instruction.

#### Notes

##### The SAA bug

The REXXSAA interpreter for OS/2 does not work [as described](../../documents/external-search-order-in-rexxsaa-for-os2.md). It should search first for "REXX functions in the current directory, with the current extension", and then for "REXX functions along environment PATH, with the current extension"; it does not, but searches for "the default extension" instead (`.CMD`). We will use the expression "**the SAA bug**" to refer to this behaviour.

##### The hasDirectory bug

OORexx for Windows has a bug in the Windows version of the SysFileSystem::hasExtension routine (a routine that determines whether a filename has or not an extension, and then takes decisions regarding the search order): it searches for the Unix separator, "/", instead of the Windows separator ("\\"). The bug (reported [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/bugs/1870/)) has passed largely unnoticed because it is difficult to trigger: one needs a filename of the form `my.path\filename`, where the path has a dot in it and the filename does not (this includes, but is not limited to, the `..\filename` and `.\file` cases). We have produced a (trivial) patch for this bug, and we are presenting the results as if the patch were already applied. Otherwise, we would find a discrepancy between the results of the test under Windows and under Ubuntu.

## Common tests

### Same (caller), current and path directories.

| Call   | SAA | OBJ | REG | OOR | Some| Comments   |
|---     |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---|
| `same` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | **1** ||
| `same.rex` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | **1** ||
| `curr` | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `curr.rex` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `path` | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `path.rex` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||

Modulo [the SAA bug](#the-saa-bug), all interpreters exhibit the same behaviour (search in the current directory, then in the `PATH`), except for ooRexx, which searches first in the "same", or caller, directory.

### Downward-relative calls

| Call   | SAA | OBJ | REG | OOR | Some| Comments   |
|---     |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---|
| `lib\samelib` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | **1** ||
| `lib\samelib.rex` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | **1** ||
| `lib\currlib` | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `lib\currlib.rex` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `lib\pathlib` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | **1** ||
| `lib\pathlib.rex` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | **1** ||

Modulo [the SAA bug](#the-saa-bug), we can classify the interpreters in three categories: those that search only in the current directory (REXXSAA, Regina), those that search in the current directory and in the `PATH` (OBJREXX), and those that, additionally, search first of all in the "same" or caller directory (ooRexx).

### Dot-relative calls

| Call   | SAA | OBJ | REG | OOR | Some| Comments   |
|---     |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---|
| `.\same` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** ||
| `.\same.rex` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** ||
| `.\curr` | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `.\curr.rex` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `.\path` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1** ||
| `.\path.rex` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1** ||

Dot-relative call tests produce a matrix which is almost identical to the downward-relative calls; modulo [the SAA bug](#the-saa-bug), REXXSAA and Regina exhibit the same behaviour (i.e., they only search in the current directory). The only test result matrix difference appears when the ooRexx interpreter is being tested: the ooRexx directory exception algorithm skips ".\file", and does not search the same directory or the `PATH`. It's interesting to note that OBJREXX _does_ search in the `PATH` in this case.

### Upward-relative calls

| Call   | SAA | OBJ | REG | OOR | Some| Comments   |
|---     |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---|
| `..\dotdotsame` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** ||
| `..\dotdotsame.rex` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** ||
| `..\dotdotcurr` | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `..\dotdotcurr.rex` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1** ||
| `..\dotdotpath` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1** ||
| `..\dotdotpath.rex` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | **1** ||

Dot-relative call tests produce a matrix which is almost identical to the downward-relative calls, and completely identical to the dot-relative calls; modulo [the SAA bug](#the-saa-bug), REXXSAA and Regina exhibit the same behaviour (i.e., they only search in the current directory). The only test result matrix difference appears when the ooRexx interpreter is being tested: the ooRexx directory exception algorithm skips "..\file", and does not search the same directory or the `PATH`. It's interesting to note that OBJREXX _does_ search in the `PATH` in this case.
