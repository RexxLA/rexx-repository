The SYNTAX directory
====================

A directory to collect documents that define the syntax of the different variants and versions of Rexx.

* [docs/](docs/) is the central documentation directory. At present, it contains
  a quite terse [log](docs/log.md) collecting all the updates and changes made to the SYNTAX directory.
* [ansirexx/](ansirexx/) contains the BNF definitions found in the ANSI Rexx standard, 
  with the corrections of the Errata applied.
* [oorexx/](oorexx/) contains a partial EBNF definition of ooRexx. At present,
  it's the collection of all the RexxRef .ebnf files found in the trunk SVN tree.
