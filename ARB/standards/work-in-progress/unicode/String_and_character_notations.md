# Unicode Draft Notes

## String and character notations

c2x, x2c

U+ notation (proto), 

Unicode escape sequence (proto), 

Literals

> (adrian) we should give the Unicode codepoint and not the UTF-8 coding when dealing with .text.

(jlf)  
c2x must return what x2c is needing to create a string from hex values.  
For NetRexx, it's a UCS-2 codepoint, limited to 16 bits.  
For cRexx, it's 32 bits because you choose to return Unicode scalar values (32 bit codepoints) and hide the internal encoding.  
For Regina and ooRexx, it's the internal encoding, whatever it is.

For all the interpreters, the 32 bit codepoints can be requested with a dedicated function, and returned as integers.  
Such integer acts as a key to query the properties of the Unicode character.
