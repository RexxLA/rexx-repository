# The 'bin' directory

This directory contains the binary files used by The Unicode Tools Of Rexx. 
Most of these binary files are multi-stage tables. The `MultiStageTable`
class, defined in `properties/Properties.cls`, does not implement generalized
multi-stage tables, but a special kind of table specialized for Unicode.

These tables are generated by the built utilities you can find in the build subdirectory.
