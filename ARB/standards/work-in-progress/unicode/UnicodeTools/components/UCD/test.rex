-- "D115 Blocked: Let A and C be two characters in a coded character sequence <A, ... C>. C is
--  blocked from A if and only if ccc(A) = 0 and there exists some character B between A
--  and C in the coded character sequence, i.e., <A, ... B, ... C>, and either ccc(B) = 0 or
--  ccc(B) >= ccc(C)."
-- "â€¢ Because the Canonical Composition Algorithm operates on a string which is
--  already in canonical order, testing whether a character is blocked requires
--  looking only at the immediately preceding character in the string."
--
-- Assume that ccc(C) == 0. The only possibility to combine is that L is the previous
-- character and there exists a Primary Composite P which is canonically equivalent to <L,C>.
