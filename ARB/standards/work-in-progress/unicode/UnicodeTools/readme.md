# The Unicode Tools Of Rexx (TUTOR)

TUTOR has moved. You can now get it at:

* https://github.com/JosepMariaBlasco/TUTOR (releases), and
* https://rexx.epbcn.com/tutor/ (releases, daily builds, live development version).

The copy at rexx.epbcn.com uses
[the Rexx Highlighter](https://rexx.epbcn.com/rexx.parser/doc/highlighter/)
for Rexx code blocks, while the GitHub copy uses the (much more limited)
GitHub highlighting.
