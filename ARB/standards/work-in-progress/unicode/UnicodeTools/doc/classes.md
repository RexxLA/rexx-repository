# New classes

* ``BYTES``. A class similar to Classic Rexx strings. A BYTES string is composed of bytes, and all the BIFs work as in pre-Unicode Rexx. The BYTES class adds a ``C2U`` method (see the description of the ``C2U`` BIF for 
  details), and reimplements a number of ooRexx built-in methods: \[\], C2X, CENTER, CENTRE, DATATYPE (a new option, ``"C"``, is implemented: ``DATATYPE(string,"C")`` will return __1__ when and only when ``"string"U`` 
  would be a valid Unicode string), LEFT, LENGTH, LOWER, POS, REVERSE, RIGHT, SUBSTR, U2C (same as ``X2C``, but for ``U`` strings), and UPPER.
* ``CODEPOINTS``. A CODEPOINTS string is composed of Unicode codepoints. CODEPOINTS is a subclass of BYTES. The CODEPOINTS class redefines the most basic BIMs (\[\] and LENGTH), and the other BIMs, being defined on 
  those, work automatically.
* ``TEXT``. A TEXT string os composed of Unicode extended grapheme clusters. TEXT is a subclass of CODEPOINTS. The TEXT class redefines the most basic BIMs (\[\] and LENGTH), and the other BIMs, being defined on
  those, work automatically.
