TUTOR is an Open Object Rexx (ooRexx) application, but some of its components can be used, with a bit of adaptation work, from Classic Rexx applications.

As a proof-of-concept, in the [components/classic](../components/classic) subdirectory, you will find two small Classic Rexx programs, ``gc.rex`` and
``testgc.rex``. They implement access to the extended ``general_category`` property data generated by TUTOR, and they have been tested under Regina Rexx.

Both programs were written in less than one hour. One has to study a little, of course: the relevant references and links can be found inside the
source code. The same techniques can be used to port these programs to entirely different environments, like CMS or TSO Rexx, for example.
I will gladly update this file if I hear news from people venturing to try these ports.
