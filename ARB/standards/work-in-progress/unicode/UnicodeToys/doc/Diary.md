# Unicode Toys: Diary

20230726: 0.2a -

* Change RUNES to CODEPOINTS everywhere.
* Now CODEPOINT strings have to end with a "P" ("C" is already taken for "C"lassic strings).
* ALLRUNES renamed to P2U (codePoints to Unicode) (returned values are suitable for U strings).
* Add P2U(string,"U+"): returns the (hex) codepoints prefixed with "U+". One char is enough.
* Add P2U(string,"NAMES"): P2U("SÃ­",names) = '(LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S) (LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE)'.
* Verify that UTF-8 is correct when creating CODEPOINTS or TEXT strings.
* Add the option to specify an encoding when creating CODEPOINTS or TEXT strings.
* Implement the UTF16 encoding. Verify that input is correct.
* Implement all concatenation and comparison methods for OPTIONS CONVERSIONS.
* Implement MAKESTRING and comparison methods, so that TEXT("61"X, UTF8) == TEXT("0061"X, UTF16).

20230726: 0.2  - Numerous changes, too many to report in complete detail here:

* Extensive refactoring.
* I'm beginning to work on abstracting the persistence level (persistent limited StringTable).
* Start implementing a property registry.
* Allow for three-stage tables in addition to two-stage tables.
* Implement LOWER and UPPER, using full case mappings (i.e., use SpecialCasing.txt in addition to UnicodeData.txt).
* Relocate binary file building routines to the ``build`` subdirectory, and self-tests to the ``tests`` subdirectory.
* Delete the ``demo`` directory and create instead a new ``samples`` directory.
* Add OPTIONS CONVERSIONS and OPTIONS DEFAULTSTRING handling to the ``rxu`` command.
* Store numerous binary properties (see ``case.cls`` in the ``properties`` subdirectory). These will come handy to implement normalization, full case folding, etc.
* Check that everything works under Linux (checked under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) (thanks Marc!).
