# The Unicode Toys

### Introduction

Unicode Toys is a set of classes, files and programs that allow to play ("toys") with Unicode concepts. 
They provide very simple implementations of several Unicode properties, like General Category, Grapheme Cluster Break or Name, 
three different types of string (BYTES, implemented by ooRexx Strings; RUNES, consisting of Unicode codepoints; and TEXT, consisting of extended grapheme clusters),
and a set of functions to convert between the three types.

Like a meccano, these components ("toys") can be modified to quickly create prototypes, proof-of-concept implementations of new functions, etc.

The included classes contain a simple implementation of a portion of Unicode functionality. I hope they can be of user to other implementors.

### Functionality of the Unicode Toys: a simple tour

To start playing with the Toys, download all the files in the [UnicodeToys[(ARB/standards/work-in-progress/unicode/UnicodeToys) directory
