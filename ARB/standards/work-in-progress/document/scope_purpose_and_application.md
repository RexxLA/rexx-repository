1 Scope, purpose, and application
1.1 Scope
This standard specifies the semantics and syntax
of the programming language Rexx by specifying
requirements for a conforming language processor.
The scope of this standard includes
- the syntax and constraints of the Rexx
language;
- the semantic rules for interpreting Rexx
programs;
- the restrictions and limitations that a
conforming language processor may impose;
- the semantics of configuration interfaces.
This standard does not specify
- the mechanism by which Rexx programs are
transformed for use by a data-processing
system;
- the mechanism by which Rexx programs are
invoked for use by a data-processing system;
- the mechanism by which input data are
transformed for use by a Rexx program;
- the mechanism by which output data are
transformed after being produced by a Rexx
program;
- the encoding of Rexx programs;
- the encoding of data to be processed by Rexx
programs;
- the encoding of output produced by Rexx
programs;
- the size or complexity of a program and its
data that will exceed the capacity of any specific
data-processing system or the capacity of a
particular language processor;
- all minimal requirements of a data-processing
system that is capable of supporting a
conforming language processor;
- the syntax of the configuration interfaces.
1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this standard is to facilitate
portability of Rexx programs for use on a wide
variety of configurations.
1.3 Application
This standard is applicable to Rexx language
processors.
1.4 Recommendation
It is recommended that before detailed reading of
this standard, a reader should first be familiar with
the Rexx language, for example through reading
one of the books about Rexx. It is also
recommended that the annexes should be read in
conjunction with this standard.
