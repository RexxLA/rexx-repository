The syntax constructs which are introduced by the optional `::' token
are known as directives.

\hypertarget{notation}{%
\section{Notation}\label{notation}}

Notation functions are functions which are not directly accessible as
functions in a program but are used in this standard as a notation for
defining semantics.

Some notation functions allow reference to syntax constructs defined in
nnn. Which instance of the syntax construct in the program is being
referred to is implied; it is the one for which the semantics are being
specified.

The BNF\_primary referenced may be directly in the production or in some
component referenced in the

production, recursively. The components are considered in left to right
order. \#Contains (Identifier, BNF primary)

where:

Identifier is an identifier in a production (see nnn) defined in nnn.

BNF\_primary is a bnf\_primary (see nnn) in a production defined in nnn.
Return `1' if the production identitied by identifier contained a
bnf\_primary identified by BNF\_primary, otherwise return `0'.

\#Instance (Identifier, BNF primary) where: Identifier is an identifier
in a production defined in nnn. BNF\_primary is a Onf\_primary in a
production defined in nnn. Returns the content of the particular
instance of the BNF\_primary. If the BNF\_primary is a VAR\_SYMBOL this
is referred to as the symbol ``taken as a constant.''

\#Evaluate (Identifier, BNF primary) where: Identifier is an identifier
in a production defined in nnn. BNF\_primary is a Onf\_primary in a
production defined in nnn. Return the value of the BNF\_primary in the
production identified by Identifier.

\#Execute (Identifier, BNF primary) where: Identifier is an identifier
in a production defined in nnn. BNF\_primary is a Onf\_primary in a
production defined in nnn. Perform the instructions identified by the
BNF\_primary in the production identified by Identifier.

\#Parses (Value, BNF primary) where: Value is a string BNF\_primary is a
Onf\_primary in a production defined in nnn. Return `1' if Value matches
the definition of the BNF\_primary, by the rules of clause 6, `0'
otherwise.

\#Clause (Label) where: Label is a label in code used by this standard
to describe processing. Return an identification of that label. The
value of this identification is used only by the \#Goto notation
function.

\#Goto (Value) where:

Value identifies a label in code used by this standard to describe
processing. The description of processing continues at the identified
label.

\#Retry ()

This notation is used in the description of interactive tracing to
specify re-execution of the clause just previously executed. It has the
effect of transferring execution to the beginning of that clause, with
state variable \#Loop set to the value it had when that clause was
previously executed.

\hypertarget{initializing}{%
\section{Initializing}\label{initializing}}

Some of the initializing, now grouped in classic section 8.2.1 will have
to come here so that we have picked up anything from the START\_API that
needs to be passed on to the execution of REQUIRES subject.

We will be using some operations that are forward reference to what was
section nnn.

\hypertarget{program-initialization-and-message-texts}{%
\subsection{Program initialization and message
texts}\label{program-initialization-and-message-texts}}

Processing of a program begins when API\_Start is executed. A pool
becomes current for the reserved

variables. call Config ObjectNew \#ReservedPool = \#Outcome \#Pool =
\#ReservedPool Is it correct to make the reserved variables and the
builtin objects in the same pool?

Some of the values which affect processing of the program are parameters
of API\_ Start:

\#Howlnvoked is set to `COMMAND', `FUNCTION' or `SUBROUTINE' according
to the first parameter of APL Start.

\#Source is set to the value of the second parameter of API\_ Start.

The third parameter of API\_Start is used to determine the initial
active environment.

The fourth parameter of API Start is used to determine the arguments.
For each argument position \#ArgExists.1.ArgNumber is set `1' if there
is an argument present, `0' if not. ArgNumber is the number of the
argument position, counting from 1. If \#ArgExists.1.ArgNumber is `1'
then \#Arg.1.ArgNumber is set to the value of the corresponding
argument. If \#ArgExists.1.ArgNumber is `0' then \#Arg.1.Arg is set to
the null string. \#ArgExists.1.0 is set to the largest n for which
\#ArgExists.1.n is `1', or to zero if there is no such value of n.

Some of the values which affect processing of the program are provided
by the configuration: call Config OtherBlankCharacters

\#A11Blanks\textless Index ``\#Al1Blanks'' \# ``\,'' \textgreater{} = '
'\#Outcome /* ``Real'' blank concatenated with others */

\#Bif Digits. = 9

call Config Constants

-true = `1'

-false = `0O'

Objects in our model are only distinquished by the values within their
pool so we can construct the builtin classes incomplete and then
complete them with directives.

Can we initialize the methods of .nil by directives?

call Config ObjectNew

-List = \#Outcome

call var\_set .List, \#IsClass, `0', `1'

call var\_set .List, \#ID, `0', `List'

Some of the state variables set by this call are limits, and appear in
the text of error messages. The relation between message numbers and
message text is defined by the following list, where the message

number appears immediately before an `=' and the message text follows in
quotes.

\#Instance(method, taken constant) call var\_value \#Class,
`\#METHODS.'\#MethodName, `1' if \#Indicator == `D' then call var set
\#Class, `\#METHODS.'\#MethodName, `1', \#Pool else call \#Raise
`SYNTAX', nn.nn, \#MethodName, \#ClassName

GUARDED \& public is default. if \#contains(method, `PRIVATE') then
m\textasciitilde setprivate; if \#contains(method, 'UNGUARDED)) then
m\textasciitilde setunguarded

Why is there a keyword for GUARDED but not for PUBLIC here?

Does CLASS option mean ENHANCE with Class class methods?

\#CurrentClass \textasciitilde class(\#instance(method,
taken\_constant), m)

For ATTRIBUTE, should we actually construct source for two methods?
ATTRIBUTE case needs test of null body. OO! doesn't have source (because
it actually traps UNKNOWN?).

For EXTERNAL test for null body. Simon Nash doc says ``Accessibility to
external methods \ldots{} is implementation-defined''. Left like that it
doesn't even tell us about search order. We will need a
Config\_ExternalClass to import the public names of the class.

\hypertarget{routine}{%
\section{ROUTINE}\label{routine}}

For each routine in order of appearence:

Add name (with duplicate check) to list for this file.

Extra step needed in the invocation search order. Although this is
nominally EXTERNAL we presumably wont use the external call mechanism.
(Except perhaps when the routine was made available by a REQUIRES; in
that case the PARSE SOURCE answer has to change.)

have the builtins-defined-by-directives elsewhere; it would make sense
if they wound up about here.
