4 Conformance
4.1. Conformance
A conforming language processor shall not
implement any variation of this standard except
where this standard permits. Such permitted
variations shall be implemented in the manner
prescribed by this standard and noted in the
documentation accompanying the processor.
A conforming processor shall include in its
accompanying documentation
- alist of all definitions or values for the
features in this standard which are specified to
be dependent on the configuration.
- a statement of conformity, giving the complete
reference of this standard (ANSI X3.274-1996)
with which conformity is claimed.
4.2 Limits
Aside from the items listed here (and the assumed
limitation in resources of the configuration), a
conforming language processor shall not put
numerical limits on the content of a program.
Where a limit expresses the limit on a number of
digits, it shall be a multiple of three. Other limits
shall be one of the numbers one, five or twenty
five, or any of these multiplied by some power of
ten.
Limitations that conforming language processors
may impose are:
- NUMERIC DIGITS values shall be supported
up to a value of at least nine hundred and
ninety nine.
- Exponents shall be supported. The limit of
the absolute value of an exponent shall be at
least as large as the largest number that can be
expressed without an exponent in nine digits.
- String lengths shall be supported. The limit
on the length shall be at least as large as the
largest number that can be expressed without
an exponent in nine digits.- String literal length
shall be supported up to at least two hundred
and fifty.
