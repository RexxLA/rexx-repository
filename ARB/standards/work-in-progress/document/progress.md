# Final revision

Up to configuration.md, also evaluation.md (in the order defined by structure.tex).

# Points to clarify

## In syntax_constructs.md

The extended Dallas report pdf stops after 6.1.6 (p. 43), and then comes a blank page (?).

The .md file _continues with material that cannot be found in the pdf_. Where does this come from? Maybe another version of the pdf?

The last paragraph in the pdf (p. 45) is found at the end of the .md file, under the heading "Syntactic equivalence".
