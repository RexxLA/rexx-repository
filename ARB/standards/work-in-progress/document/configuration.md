# Configuration

Any implementation of this standard will be functioning within a configuration. In practice, the boundary
between what is implemented especially to support Rexx and what is provided by the system will vary
from system to system. This clause describes what they shall together do to provide the configuration for
the Rexx language processing which is described in this standard.

_We don't want to add undue "magic" to this section. It seems we will need the concept of a "reference" (equivalent to
a machine address) so that this section can at least have composite objects as arguments. (As it already does but
these are not Rexx objects)_

_Possibly we could unify "reference" with "variable pool number" since object one-to-one with its variable pool is a fair
model. That way we don't need a new primitive for comparison of two references._

_JAVA is only a "reference" for NetRexx so some generalized JAVA-like support is needed for that. It would provide
the answers to what classes were in the context, what their method signatures were etc._

## Notation

The interface to the configuration is described in terms of functions. The notation for describing the
interface functionally uses the name given to the function, followed by any arguments. This does not
constrain how a specific implementation provides the function, nor does it imply that the order of
arguments is significant for a specific implementation.

The names of the functions are used throughout this standard; the names used for the arguments are
used only in this clause and nnn.

The name of a function refers to its usage. A function whose name starts with

- `Config_` is used only from the language processor when processing programs;

- `API_` is part of the application programming interface and is accessible from programs which are not written in the Rexx language;

- `Trap_` is not provided by the language processor but may be invoked by the language processor.
 
As its result, each function shall return a completion `Response`. This is a string indicating how the function
behaved. The completion response may be the character `'N'` indicating the normal behavior occurred;
otherwise the first character is an indicator of a different behavior and the remainder shall be suitable as a
human-readable description of the function's behavior.

This standard defines any additional results from `Config_` functions as made available to the language
processor in variables. This does not constrain how a particular implementation should return these
results.

### Notation for completion response and conditions

As alternatives to the normal indicator `'N'`, each function may return a completion response with indicator
`'X'` or `'S'`; other possible indicators are described for each function explicitly. The indicator `'X'` means that
the function failed because resources were exhausted. The indicator `'S'` shows that the configuration was
unable to perform the function.

Certain indicators cause conditions to be raised. The possible raising of these conditions is implicit in the
use of the function; it is not shown explicitly when the functions are used in this standard.

The implicit action is

```rexx
call #Raise 'SYNTAX', Message, Description
```

where:

* `#Raise` raises the condition, see nnn.
* `Message` is determined by the indicator in the completion response. If the indicator is `'X'` then
   `Message` is `5.1`. If the indicator is `'S'` then Message is `48.1`.
* `Description` is the description in the completion response.

The `'SYNTAX'` condition `5.1` can also be raised by any other activity of the language processor.

## Processing initiation

The processing initiation interface consists of a function which the configuration shall provide to invoke
the language processor.

_We could do `REQUIRES` in a macro-expansion way by adding an argument to `Config_SourceChar` to specify the
source file. However, I'm assuming we will prefer to recursively "run" each required file. One of the results of that will
be the classes and methods made public by that `REQUIRES` subject._

### API Start
Syntax:

```rexx
API_Start(How, Source, Environment, Arguments, Streams, Traps, Provides)
```

where:

* `How` is one of `'COMMAND'`, `'FUNCTION'`, or `'SUBROUTINE'` and indicates how the program is
  invoked.

_What does OOI say for How when running REQUIREd files?_

* `Source` is an identification of the source of the program to be processed.

* `Environment` is the initial value of the environment to be used in processing commands. This has
  components for the name of the environment and how the input and output of commands is to be
  directed.

* `Arguments` is the initial argument list to be used in processing. This has components to specify the
  number of arguments, which arguments are omitted, and the values of arguments that are not
  omitted.

* `Streams` has components for the default input stream to be used and the default output streams to
  be used.

* `Traps` is the list of traps to be used in processing (see nnn). This has components to specify
  whether each trap is omitted or not.

#### Semantics:

This function starts the execution of a Rexx program.

If the program was terminated due to a `RETURN` or `EXIT` instruction without an expression the
completion response is `'N'`.

If the program was terminated due to a `RETURN` or `EXIT` instruction with an expression the indicator
in the completion response is `'R'` and the description of the completion response is the value of the
expression.

If the program was terminated due to an error the indicator in the completion response is `'E'` and the
description in the completion response comprises information about the error that terminated
processing.

If How was `'REQUIRED'` and the completion response was not `'E'`, the `Provides` argument is set to
reference classes made available. See nnn for the semantics of these classes.

## Source programs and character sets

The configuration shall provide the ability to access source programs (see nnn).
Source programs consist of characters belonging to the following categories:

- _syntactic_characters_;
- _extra_letters_;
- _other_blank_characters_;
- _other_negators_;
- _other_characters_.

A character shall belong to only one category.

### Syntactic_characters

The following characters represent the category of characters called _syntactic_characters_, identified by
their names. The glyphs used to represent them in this document are also shown. _Syntactic_characters_
shall be available in every configuration:

### Extra_letters

A configuration may have a category of characters in source programs called _extra_letters_. _Extra_letters_
are determined by the configuration.

### Other_blank_characters

A configuration may have a category of characters in source programs called _other_blank_characters_.
_Other_blank_characters_ are determined by the configuration. Only the following characters represent
possible characters of this category:

- carriage return;
- form feed;
- horizontal tabulation;
- new line;
- vertical tabulation.

### Other_negators

A configuration may have a category of characters in source programs called _other_negators_.
_Other_negators_ are determined by the configuration. Only the following characters represent possible
characters of this category. The glyphs used to represent them in this document are also shown:

- ^ circumflex accent, caret;
- Â¬ not sign.

### Other_characters

A configuration may have a category of characters in source programs called _other_characters_.
_Other_characters_ are determined by the configuration.

## Configuration characters and encoding
The configuration characters and encoding interface consists of functions which the configuration shall
provide which are concerned with the encoding of characters.

The following functions shall be provided:

- `Config_SourceChar`;
- `Config_OtherBlankCharacters`;
- `Config_Upper`;
- `Config_Compare`;
- `Config_B2C`;
- `Config_C2B`;

### Config_SourceChar

#### Syntax:

```rexx
Config_SourceChar()
```

#### Semantics:

Supply the characters of the source program in sequence, together with the _EOL_ and _EOS_ events.
The _EOL_ event represents the end of a line. The _EOS_ event represents the end of the source
program. The _EOS_ event must only occur immediately after an _EOL_ event. Either a character or an
event is supplied on each invocation, by setting `#Outcome`.

If this function is unable to supply a character because the source program encoding is incorrect the
indicator of the completion response is `'E'` and the description of the completion information is the
encoding which is incorrect, in hexadecimal notation.

### Config_OtherBlankCharacters

#### Syntax:

```rexx
Config_OtherBlankCharacters()
```

#### Semantics:

Get _other_blank_characters_ (see nnn).

Set `#Outcome` to a string of zero or more distinct characters in arbitrary order. Each character is one
that the configuration considers equivalent to the character _Blank_ for the purposes of parsing.

### Config_Upper

#### Syntax:

Config_Upper(Character)

where:

Character is the character to be translated to uppercase.

#### Semantics:

Translate Character to uppercase. Set #Outcome to the translated character. Characters which have
been subject to this translation are referred to as being in uppercase. Config_Upper applied to a
character in uppercase must not change the character.

### Config_Lower

#### Syntax:

Config_Lower(Character)

where:

Character is the character to be translated to lowercase.

#### Semantics:

Translate Character to lowercase. Set #Outcome to the translated character. Characters which have
been subject to this translation are referred to as being in lowercase. Config_Lower applied to a
character in lowercase must not change the character. Config_Upper of the outcome of
Config_Lower(Character) shall be the original character.

### Config_Compare

#### Syntax:

Config Compare(Characterl, Character2)

where:

Character1 is the character to be compared with Character2.

Character2 is the character to be compared with Character1.

#### Semantics:

Compare two characters. Set #Outcome to

- 'equal' if Character1 is equal to Character2;

- 'greater' if Character1 is greater than Character2;

- 'lesser' if Character' is less than Character2.
- 
The function shall exhibit the following characteristics. If Config _Compare(a,b) produces

- 'equal' then Config_Compare(b,a) produces 'equal';

- 'greater' then Config_Compare(b,a) produces 'lesser';

- 'lesser' then Config_Compare(b,a) produces 'greater';

- 'equal' and Config_Compare(b,c) produces 'equal' then Config_Compare(a,c) produces 'equal';

- 'greater' and Config_Compare(b,c) produces 'greater' then Config _Compare(a,c) produces
'greater';

- 'lesser' and Config _Compare(b,c) produces 'lesser' then Config_Compare(a,c) produces 'lesser';

- 'equal' then Config_Compare(a,c) and Config_Compare(b,c) produce the same value.
- 
Syntactic characters which are different characters shall not compare equal by Config_Compare, see
nnn.

### Config _B2C

#### Syntax:

Config B2C (Binary)

where:

Binary is a sequence of digits, each '0' or '1'. The number of digits shall be a multiple of eight.

#### Semantics:

Translate Binary to a coded string. Set #Outcome to the resulting string. The string may, or may not,
correspond to a sequence of characters.

### Config_C2B

#### Syntax:

Config C2B (String)

where:

String is a string.

#### Semantics:

Translate String to a sequence of digits, each '0' or '1'. Set #Outcome to the result. This function is the
inverse of Config_B2C.

### Config_Substr

#### Syntax:

Config Substr(String, n)

where:

String is a string.

n is an integer identifying a position within String.

#### Semantics:

Copy the n-th character from String. The leftmost character is the first character. Set Outcome to the
resulting character.

If this function is unable to supply a character because there is no n-th character in String the indicator
of the completion response is 'M'.

If this function is unable to supply a character because the encoding of String is incorrect the indicator
of the completion response is 'E' and the description of the completion information is the encoding
which is incorrect, in hexadecimal notation.

### Config Length

#### Syntax:

Config Length (String)

where:

String is a string.

#### Semantics:

Set #Outcome to the length of the string, that is, the number of characters in the string.

If this function is unable to determine a length because the encoding of String is incorrect, the
indicator of the completion response is 'E' and the description of the completion information is the
encoding which is incorrect, in hexadecimal notation.

### Config_Xrange

#### Syntax:

Config Xrange(Characterl, Character2)

where:

Character1 is the null string, or a single character.

Character2 is the null string, or a single character.

#### Semantics:

If Character1 is the null string then let LowBound be a lowest ranked character in the character set
according to the ranking order provided by Config_Compare; otherwise let LowBound be Character1.

If Character2 is the null string then let HighBound be a highest ranked character in the character set
according to the ranking order provided by Config_Compare; otherwise let HighBound be Character2lf
#Outcome after Config_Compare(LowBound,HighBound) has a value of

- 'equal' then #Outcome is set to LowBound;

- 'lesser' then #Outcome is set to the sequence of characters between LowBound and HighBound
inclusively, in ranking order;

- 'greater' then #Outcome is set to the sequence of characters HighBound and larger, in ranking
order, followed by the sequence of characters LowBound and smaller, in ranking order.

## Objects

The objects interface consists of functions which the configuration shall provide for creating objects.

### Config_ObjectNew

#### Syntax:

Config ObjectNew

#### Semantics:

Set #Outcome to be a reference to an object. The object shall be suitable for use as a variable pool,
see nnn. This function shall never return a value in #Outcome which compares equal with the value
returned on another invokation of the function.

### Config_Array_Size

#### Syntax:

Config Array Size(Object, size)

where:

Object is an object.

Size is an integer greater or equal to 0.

#### Semantics:

The configuration should prepare to deal efficiently with the object as an array with indexes having
values up to the value of size.

### Config_Array_Put

#### Syntax:

Config Array Put(Array, Item, Index)

where:

Array is an array.

Item is an object

Index is an integer greater or equal to 1.

#### Semantics:

The configuration shall record that the array has Item associated with Index.

### Config_Array_At

#### Syntax:

Config Array At(Array, Index)

where:

where:

Array is an array.

Index is an integer greater or equal to 1.

#### Semantics:

After this operation, no item is associated with the Index in the Array.

## Commands

The commands interface consists of a function which the configuration shall provide for strings to be
passed as commands to an environment.

See nnn and nnn for a description of language features that use commands.

### Config _Command

#### Syntax:

Config Command(Environment, Command)

where:

Environment is the environment to be addressed. It has components for:

- the name of the environment;

- the name of a stream from which the command will read its input. The null string indicates use of
the default input stream;

- the name of a stream onto which the command will write its output. The null string indicates use
of the default output stream. There is an indication of whether writing is to APPEND or REPLACE;

- the name of a stream onto which the command will write its error output. The null string indicates
use of the default error output stream. There is an indication of whether writing is to APPEND or
REPLACE.

Command is the command to be executed.

#### Semantics:

Perform a command.

- set the indicator to 'E' or 'F' if the command ended with an ERROR condition, or a FAILURE
condition, respectively;

- set #RC to the return code string of the command.

## External routines

The external routines interface consists of a function which the configuration shall provide to invoke
external routines.

See nnn and nnn for a description of the language features that use external routines.

### Config_ExternalRoutine

#### Syntax:

Config ExternalRoutine(How, NameType, Name, Environment, Arguments, Streams, Traps)
where:

How is one of 'FUNCTION' or 'SUBROUTINE' and indicates how the external routine is to be
invoked.

NameType is a specification of whether the name was provided as a symbol or as a string literal.
Name is the name of the routine to be invoked.

Environment is an environment value with the same components as on API_ Start.

Arguments is a specification of the arguments to the routine, with the same components as on
API Start.

Streams is a specification of the default streams, with the same components as on API_ Start.

Traps is the list of traps to be used in processing, with the same components as on API_ Start.

#### Semantics:

Invoke an external routine. Set {Outcome to the result of the external routine, or set the indicator of
the completion response to 'D' if the external routine did not provide a result.

If this function is unable to locate the routine the indicator of the completion response is 'U'. As a result
SYNTAX condition 43.1 is raised implicitly.

If How indicated that a result from the routine was required but the routine did not provide one the
indicator of the completion response is 'H'. As a result SYNTAX condition 44.1 is raised implicitly.

If How indicated that a result from the routine was required but the routine provided one that was too
long (see #Limit_String in nnn) the indicator of the completion response is 'L'. As a result SYNTAX
condition 52 is raised implicitly.

If the routine failed in a way not indicated by some other indicator the indicator of the completion
response is 'F'. As a result SYNTAX condition 40.1 is raised implicitly.

### Config_ExternalMethod

OOI has external classes explicitly via the ::CLASS abc EXTERNAL mechanism. Analogy with classic would also
allow the subject of ::REQUIRES to be coded in non-Rexx. However ::REQUIRES subject is coded, we need to
gather in knowledge of its method names because of the search algorithm that determines which method is called.
Hence reasonable that the ultimate external call is to a method. Perhaps combine Config_ExternalRoutine with
Config_ExternalMethod.

There is a terminology clash on "environment". Perhaps easiest to change the classic to "address_environment".
(And make it part of new "environment"?)

There are terminology decisions to make about "files", "programs", and "packages". Possibly "program" is the thing
you run (and we don't say what it means physically), "file" is a unit of scope (ROUTINEs in current file before those in
REQUIREd), and "package" we don't use (since a software package from a shop would probably have several files
but not everything to run a program.) Using "file" this way may not be too bad since we used "stream" rather than
"tile" in the classic definition.

The How parameter will need 'METHOD' as a value. Should API_Start also allow 'METHOD". If we pass the new
Environment we don't have to pass Streams separately.

Text of Config_ExternalMethod waiting on such decisions.

#### Syntax:

Config ExternalMethod (How, NameType, Name, Environment, Arguments, Streams, Traps)

where:

How is one of 'FUNCTION' or 'SUBROUTINE' and indicates how the external routine is to be
invoked.

NameType is a specification of whether the name was provided as a symbol or as a string literal.

Name is the name of the routine to be invoked.

Environment is an environment value with the same components as on API_ Start.

Arguments is a specification of the arguments to the routine, with the same components as on
API_Start.

Streams is a specification of the default streams, with the same components as on API_ Start.

Traps is the list of traps to be used in processing, with the same components as on API_ Start.

#### Semantics:

Invoke an external routine. Set {Outcome to the result of the external routine, or set the indicator of
the completion response to 'D' if the external routine did not provide a result.

If this function is unable to locate the routine the indicator of the completion response is 'U'. As a result
SYNTAX condition 43.1 is raised implicitly.

If How indicated that a result from the routine was required but the routine did not provide one the
indicator of the completion response is 'H'. As a result SYNTAX condition 44.1 is raised implicitly.

If How indicated that a result from the routine was required but the routine provided one that was too
long (see #Limit_String in nnn) the indicator of the completion response is 'L'. As a result SYNTAX
condition 52 is raised implicitly.

If the routine failed in a way not indicated by some other indicator the indicator of the completion
response is 'F'. As a result SYNTAX condition 40.1 is raised implicitly.

## External data queue

The external data queue interface consists of functions which the configuration shall provide to
manipulate an external data queue mechanism.

See nnn, nnn, nnn, nnn, and nnn for a description of language features that use the external data queue.
The configuration shall provide an external data queue mechanism. The following functions shall be
provided:

- Config_Push;

- Config _Queue;

- Config_ Pull;

- Config_Queued.

The configuration may permit the external data queue to be altered in other ways. In the absence of such
alterations the external data queue shall be an ordered list. Config_Push adds the specified string to one
end of the list, Config _Queue to the other. Config_Pull removes a string from the end that Config_Push
adds to unless the list is empty.

### Config Push

#### Syntax:

Config Push(String)

where:

String is the value to be retained in the external data queue.

#### Semantics:

Add String as an item to the end of the external data queue from which Config_Pull will remove an
item.

### Contig_Queue

#### Syntax:

Config Queue (String)

where:

String is the value to be retained in the external data queue.

#### Semantics:

Add String as an item to the opposite end of the external data queue from which Config_Pull will
remove an item.

### Config_Pull

#### Syntax:

Config Pull()

#### Semantics:

Retrieve an item from the end of the external data queue to which Config_Push adds an element to
the list. Set #Outcome to the value of the retrieved item.

If no item could be retrieved the indicator of the completion response is 'F'.

### Contig_Queued

#### Syntax:

Config Queued ()

#### Semantics:

Get the count of items in the external data queue. Set #Outcome to that number.

## Streams

The streams interface consists of functions which the configuration shall provide to manipulate streams.
See nnn, nnn, and nnn for a description of language features which use streams.

Streams are identified by names and provide for the reading and writing of data. They shall support the
concepts of characters, lines, positioning, default input stream and default output stream.

The concept of a persistent stream shall be supported and the concept of a transient stream may be
supported. A persistent stream is one where the content is not expected to change except when the
stream is explicitly acted on. A transient stream is one where the data available is expected to vary with
time.

The concepts of binary and character streams shall be supported. The content of a character stream is
expected to be characters.

The null string is used as a name for both the default input stream and the default output stream. The null
string names the default output stream only when it is an argument to the Config_Stream_Charout
operation.

The following functions shall be provided:

- Config_Stream_Charin;

- Config_Stream_Position;

- Config_Stream_Command;

- Config_Stream_State;

- Config_Stream_Charout;

- Config_Stream_Qualified;

- Config_Stream_Unique;

- Config_Stream_Query;

- Config_Stream_Close;

- Config_Stream_Count.
- 
The results of these functions are described in terms of the following stems with tails which are stream
names:

- #Charin_Position.Stream;

- #Charout_Position.Stream;

- #Linein_Position.Stream;

- #Lineout_Position.Stream.

### Config _Stream_Charin

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Charin(Stream, OperationType)

where:

Stream is the name of the stream to be processed.

OperationType is one of 'CHARIN', 'LINEIN', or 'NULL.

#### Semantics:

Read from a stream. Increase #Linein_Position.Stream by one when the end-of-line indication is
encountered. Increase #Charin_Position.Stream when the indicator will be 'N'.

If OperationType is 'CHARIN' the state variables describing the stream will be affected as follows:
- when the configuration is able to provide data from a transient stream or the character at position
#Charin_Position.Stream of a persistent stream then #Outcome shall be set to contain the data.

The indicator of the response shall be 'N';

- when the configuration is unable to return data because the read position is at the end of a
persistent stream then the indicator of the response shall be 'O';
- when the configuration is unable to return data from a transient stream because no data is
available and no data is expected to become available then the indicator of the response shall be
'O':
- otherwise the configuration is unable to return data and does not expect to be able to return data
by waiting; the indicator of the response shall be 'E'.
The data set in #Outcome will either be a single character or will be a sequence of eight characters,
each '0' or '1'. The choice is decided by the configuration. The eight character sequence indicates a
binary stream, see nnn.

If OperationType is 'LINEIN' then the action is the same as if Operation had been 'CHARIN' with the
following additional possibility. If end-of-line is detected any character (or character sequence) which
is an embedded indication of the end-of-line is skipped. The characters skipped contribute to the
change of #Charin_Position.Stream. #Outcome is the null string.

If OperationType is 'NULL' then the stream is accessed but no data is read.

### Config_Stream_Position

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Position(Stream, OperationType, Position)

where:

Stream is the name of the stream to be processed.

Operation is 'CHARIN', 'LINEIN', 'CHAROUT', or 'LINEOUT'.

Position indicates where to position the stream.

#### Semantics:

If the operation is 'CHARIN' or 'CHAROUT' then Position is a character position, otherwise Position is
a line position.

If Operation is 'CHARIN' or 'LINEIN' and the Position is beyond the limit of the existing data then the
indicator of the completion response shall be 'R'. Otherwise if Operation is 'CHARIN' or 'LINEIN' set
#Charin_Position.Stream to the position from which the next Config_Stream_Charin on the stream
shall read, as indicated by Position. Set #Linein_Position.Stream to correspond with this position.

If Operation is 'CHAROUT' or 'LINEOQUT' and the Position is more than one beyond the limit of existing
data then the indicator of the response shall be 'R'. Otherwise if Operation is 'CHAROUT' or
'LINEOUT' then #Charout_Position.Stream is set to the position at which the next
Config_Stream_Charout on the stream shall write, as indicated by Position. Set
#Lineout_Position.Stream to correspond with this position.

If this function is unable to position the stream because the stream is transient then the indicator of the
completion response shall be 'T'.

### Config _Stream_Command

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Command (Stream, Command)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be processed.
Command is a configuration-specific command to be performed against the stream.
Semantics:
Issue a configuration-specific command against a stream. This may affect all state variables
describing Stream which hold position information. It may alter the effect of any subsequent operation
on the specified stream. If the indicator is set to 'N', #Outcome shall be set to information from the
command.

### Config_Stream_State

#### Syntax:

Config Stream State (Stream)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be queried.
Semantics:
Set the indicator to reflect the state of the stream. Return an indicator equal to the indicator that an
immediately subsequent Config_Stream_Charin(Stream, 'CHARIN') would return. Alternatively, return
an indicator of 'U'.

The remainder of the response shall be a configuration-dependent description of the state of the
stream.

### Config_Stream_Charout

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Charout (Stream, Data)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be processed.
Data is the data to be written, or 'EOL' to indicate that an end-of-line indication is to be written, or a
null string. In the first case, if the stream is a binary stream then Data will be eight characters, each
'0' or '1', otherwise Data will be a single character.
Semantics:
When Data is the null string, no data is written.
Otherwise write to the stream. The state variables describing the stream will be affected as follows:

- when the configuration is able to write Data to a transient stream or at position
#Charout_Position.Stream of a persistent stream then the indicator in the response shall be 'N'.
When Data is not 'EOL' then #Charout_Position.Stream is increased by one. When Data is 'EOL',
then #Lineout_Position.Stream is increased by one and #Charout_Position.Stream is increased as
necessary to account for any end-of-line indication embedded in the stream;

- when the configuration is unable to write Data the indicator is set to 'E'.

### Config_Stream_Qualified

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Qualified (Stream)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be processed.
Semantics:
Set #Outcome to some name which identifies Stream.
Return a completion response with indicator 'B' if the argument is not acceptable to the configuration
as identifying a stream.

### Config_Stream_Unique

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Unique ()
Semantics:
Set #Outcome to a name that the configuration recognizes as a stream name. The name shall not be
a name that the configuration associates with any existing data.

### Config_Stream_Query
 
#### Syntax:
Config Stream Query (Stream)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be queried.
Semantics:
Set #Outcome to 'B' if the stream is a binary stream, or to 'C' if it is a character stream.

### Config_Stream_Close

#### Syntax:

Config Stream Close (Stream)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be closed.
Semantics:
#Charout_Position.Stream and #Lineout_Position.Stream are set to 1 unless the stream has existing
data, in which case they are set ready to write immediately after the existing data.
If this function is unable to position the stream because the stream is transient then the indicator of the
completion response shall be 'T'.

### Config _Stream_Count

#### Syntax:
Config Stream Count (Stream, Operation, Option)
where:
Stream is the name of the stream to be counted.
Operation is 'CHARS', or 'LINES'.

Option is 'N' or 'C'.
Semantics:
If the option is 'N', #Outcome is set to zero if:

- the file is transient and no more characters (or no more lines if the Operation is 'LINES') are
expected to be available, even after waiting;

- the file is persistent and no more characters (or no more lines if the Operation is 'LINES') can be
obtained from this stream by Config_Stream_Charin before use of some function which resets
#Charin_Position.Stream and #Linein_Position.Stream.

If the option is 'N' and #Outcome is set nonzero, #Outcome shall be 1, or be the number of characters
(or the number of lines if Operation is 'LINES') which could be read from the stream before resetting.

If the option is 'C', #Outcome is set to zero if:

- the file is transient and no characters (or no lines if the Operation is 'LINES') are available without
waiting;

- the file is persistent and no more characters (or no more lines if the Operation is 'LINES') can be
obtained from this stream by Config_Stream_Charin before use of some function which resets
#Charin_Position.Stream and #Linein_Position.Stream.
If the option is 'C' and #Outcome is set nonzero, #Outcome shall be the number of characters (or the
number of lines if the Operation is 'LINES') which can be read from the stream without delay and
before resetting.

## External variable pools
The external variable pools interface consists of functions which the configuration shall provide to
manipulate variables in external variable pools.
See nnn for the VALUE built-in function which uses external variable pools.
The configuration shall provide an external variable pools mechanism. The following functions shall be

value.
If Poolid does not identify an external pool provided by this configuration, the indicator of the
completion response is 'P'.
If Name is not a valid name of a variable in the external pool, the indicator of the completion response
is 'F'.

### Config Set

#### Syntax:
Config Set (Poolid, Name, Value)

where:
Poolid is an identification of the external variable pool.
Name is the name of a variable.
Value is the value to be assigned to the variable.

used;

- set variables #Limit_Digits, #Limit_EnvironmentName, #Limit_ExponentDigits, #Limit_Literal,
#Limit_Messagelnsert, #Limit_Name, #Limit_String, #Limit_TraceData to the relevant limits. A
configuration shall allow a #Limit_Messagelnsert value of 50 to be specified. A configuration shall
allow a #Limit_TraceData value of 250 to be specified;

- set #Configuration to a string identifying the configuration;

- set #Version to a string identifying the language processor. It shall have five words. Successive
words shall be separated by a blank character. The first four letters of the first word shall be
'REXX'. The second word shall be the four characters '5.00'. The last three words comprise a date.
This shall be in the format which is the default for the DATE() built-in function.

- set .nil to a value which compares unequal with any other value that can occur in execution.

processor, at various points in processing where it would otherwise be output. Otherwise, set
#NoSource to '0'.
A configuration shall allow any program to be processed in such a way that Config_NoSource() sets
#NoSource to '0'. A configuration may allow any program to be processed in such a way that
Config_NoSource() sets #NoSource to '1'.

### Config_Time

#### Syntax:

Config Time ()

Semantics:
Get a time stamp. Set #Time to a string whose value is the integer number of microseconds that have
elapsed between 00:00:00 on January first 0001 and the time that Config_Time is called, at longitude
zero. Values sufficient to allow for any date in the year 9999 shall be supported. The value returned
may be an approximation but shall not be smaller than the value returned by a previous use of the
function.

Set #Adjust<Index "#Adjust" #"" > to an integer number of microseconds. #Adjust<Index "#Adjust" #
â¢ > reflects the difference between the local date/time and the date/time corresponding to #Time.

come from an OPTIONS instruction, see nnn.

## Traps

The trapping interface consists of functions which may be provided by the caller of API_Start (see nnn) as
a list of traps. Each trap may be specified or omitted. The language processor shall invoke a specified
trap before, or instead of, using the corresponding feature of the language processor itself. This
correspondence is implied by the choice of names; that is, a name beginning Trap_ will correspond to a
name beginning Config_ when the remainder of the name is the same. Corresponding functions are
called with the same interface, with one exception. The exception is that a trap may return a null string.
When a trap returns a null string, the corresponding Config_ function is invoked; otherwise the invocation
of the trap replaces the potential invocation of the Config_ function.
In the rest of this standard, the trapping mechanism is not shown explicitly. It is implied by the use of a
Config_ function.
The names of the traps are

- Trap_Command;

- Trap_ExternalRoutine;

- Trap_Push;

- Trap_Queue;

- Trap_Pull;

- Trap_Queued;

- Trap_Trace_Query;

- Trap_Trace_Input;

- Trap_Trace_Output;

- Trap_Default_Input;

- Trap_Default_Output;

- Trap_Initialization;

- Trap_Termination;

- Trap_Halt_Query;

- Trap_Halt_Reset.

## Variable pool

How does this fit with variables as properties?

The variable pool interface consists of functions which the configuration shall provide to manipulate the
variables and to obtain some characteristics of a Rexx program.

These functions can be called from programs not written in Rexx _ commands and external routines
invoked from a Rexx program, or traps invoked from the language processor.

All the functions comprising the variable pool interface shall return with an indication of whether an error
occurred. They shall return indicating an error and have no other effect, if #API_Enabled has a value of '0'
or if the arguments to them fail to meet the defined syntactic constraints.

These functions interact with the processing of clauses. To define this interaction, the functions are
described here in terms of the processing of variables, see nnn.

Some of these functions have an argument which is a symbol. A symbol is a string. The content of the
string shall meet the syntactic constraints of the left hand side of an assignment. Conversion to
uppercase and substitution in compound symbols occurs as it does for the left hand side of an
assignment. The symbol identifies the variable to be operated upon.

Some of the functions have an argument which is a direct symbol. A direct symbol is a string. The content
of this string shall meet the syntactic constraints of a VAR_SYMBOL in uppercase with no periods or it
shall be the concatenation of a part meeting the syntactic constraints of a stem in uppercase, and a part
that is any string. In the former case the symbol identifies the variable to be operated upon. In the latter
case the variable to be operated on is one with the specified stem and a tail which is the remainder of the
direct symbol.

Functions that have an argument which is symbol or direct symbol shall return an indication of whether
the identified variable existed before the function was executed.
Clause nnn defines functions which manipulate Rexx variable pools. Where possible the functions
comprising the variable pool interface are described in terms of the appropriate invocations of the
functions defined in nnn. The first parameter on these calls is the state variable #Pool. If these Var_
functions do not return an indicator 'N', 'R', or 'D' then the API function shall return an error indication.

### API Set

#### Syntax:

API Set(Symbol, Value)
where:
Symbol is a symbol.
Value is the string whose value is to be assigned to the variable.
Semantics:
Assign the value of Value to the variable identified by Symbol. If Symbol contains no periods or
contains one period as its last character:
Var_ Set(#Pool, Symbol, '0', Value)
Otherwise:
Var _Set(#Pool, #Symbol, '1', Value)
where:
#Symbol is Symbol after any replacements in the tail as described by nnn.

### API Value

#### Syntax:

API Value (Symbol)

where:
Symbol is a symbol.
Semantics:
Return the value of the variable identified by Symbol. If Symbol contains no periods or contains one

period as its last character this is the value of #Outcome after:
Var _Value(#Pool, Symbol, '0')

Otherwise the value of #Outcome after:
Var Value(#Pool, #Symbol, '1')
where:
#Symbol is Symbol after any replacements in the tail as described by nnn.

### API_Drop

#### Syntax:

API Drop (Symbol)

where:
Symbol is a symbol.
Semantics:
Drop the variable identified by Symbol. If Symbol contains no periods or contains one period as its last
character:
Var Drop(#Pool, Symbol, '0')
Otherwise:
Var Drop(#Pool, #Symbol, '1')
where:
#Symbol is Symbol after any replacements in the tail as described by nnn.

### API SetDirect

#### Syntax:

API SetDirect (Symbol, Value)

where:
Symbol is a direct symbol.
Value is the string whose value is to be assigned to the variable.
Semantics:

Assign the value of Value to the variable identified by Symbol. If the Symbol contains no period:
Var_ Set(#Pool, Symbol, '0', Value)

Otherwise:
Var_ Set(#Pool, Symbol, '1', Value)

### API_ValueDirect

#### Syntax:

API ValueDirect (Symbol)

where:
Symbol is a direct symbol.
Semantics:
Return the value of the variable identified by Symbol. If the Symbol contains no period:
Var _Value(#Pool, Symbol, '0')
Otherwise:
Var _Value(#Pool, Symbol, '1')

### API DropDirect

#### Syntax:

API DropDirect (Symbol)

where:
Symbol is a direct symbol.
Semantics:

Drop the variable identified by Symbol. If the Symbol contains no period:
Var Drop(#Pool, Symbol, '0')

Otherwise:
Var Drop(#Pool, Symbol, '1')

### API ValueOther

#### Syntax:

API ValueOther (Qualifier)
where:
Qualifier is an indication distinguishing the result to be returned including any necessary further
qualification.
Semantics:
Return characteristics of the program, depending on the value of Qualifier. The possibilities for the
value to be returned are:

- the value of #Source;

- the value of #Version;

- the largest value of n such that #ArgExists.1.n is '1', see nnn;

- the value of #Arg.1.n where n is an integer value provided as input.

### API Next

#### Syntax:

API Next ()

Semantics:

Returns both the name and the value of some variable in the variable pool that does not have the
attribute 'dropped' or the attribute 'implicit' and is not a stem; alternatively return an indication that
there is no suitable name to return. When API_Next is called it will return a name that has not
previously been returned; the order is undefined. This process of returning different names will restart
whenever the Rexx processor executes Var_Reset.

### API NextVariable

#### Syntax:

API NextVariable()

Semantics:

Returns both the name and the value of some variable in the variable pool that does not have the
attribute 'dropped' or the attribute 'implicit'; alternatively, return an indication that there is no suitable name
to return. When API NextVariable is called it will return data about a variable that has not previously been
returned; the order is undefined. This process of returning different names will restart whenever the Rexx
processor executes Var_Reset. In addition to the name and value, an indication of whether the variable
was 'tailed' will be returned.
