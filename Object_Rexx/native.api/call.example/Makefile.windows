# This is a Visual C++, nMake compatible make file.
#
# The compiler needs to be able to find the ooRexx native API headers and
# libraries. If REXX_HOME is set on the system, the correct directory will be
# automatically added to the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables by this make
# file.
#
# Otherwise, either uncomment the next line and define the correct REXX_HOME, or
# be sure the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables allow the compiler to find
# the ooRexx native API headers and libraries.
#
# On a build system for ooRexx, you can set REXX_HOME to point to Win32Dbg or
# Win32Rel, as appropriate, in your build directory.  For this to work, you
# will have to have built the interpreter.

#REXX_HOME = C:\work.ooRexx\wc\main\Win32Dbg   # For example

# Define RELEASE on the command line, or here, to build a non-debug version.  By
# default debug versions are built.  I.e. nMake RELEASE=1 /F Makefile
#RELEASE = 1
