  	ReadMe
    ======

    This subdirectory provides two examples: runRexxProgram and
    stackOverflow.  Both programs will compile and run on any platform
    supported by ooRexx. Also included are 2 make files.

    Makefile.windows
    ----------------
    This is a nMake compatible make file for building the examples on
    Windows.  Provided your build environment is set up correctly for a
    MicroSoft's Visual C++ compile, you should be able to compile the
    examples without problem.  Read the comments in Makefile.windows if
    your have problems and / or to see how to build a debug version (the
    default) or a non-debug version of the samples.

    Makefile.linux
    --------------
    This make file should build the examples on any Unix-like system that
    has gcc installed.


    runRexxProgram
    ==============
    This example creates an instance of the interpreter and uses it to call
    a Rexx program.  The Rexx program name is supplied on the command line.
    For instance:

    runRexxProgram HelloWorld.rex

    Read the comments in the program code for additional details.  A few
    sample Rexx programs are provided, including backward.fnc


    stackOverflow
    =============
    This example creates an instance of the interpreter and then
    dynamically creates and calls a Rexx routine.  Two routines are
    provided.  Execute stackOverflow without any arguments to use the first
    routine and with one (any) argument to use the second routine.  I.e.:

    stackOverflow

    or

    stackOverflow 1

    More details are provided in comments within the C++ code.
