    ======

    ooRexx 4.0.0 introduced a new (at the time) C++ API for writing
    extensions to the ooRexx interpreter.  This API makes it possible for
    the extension developer to make better, and more robust, use of the
    interpreter.  In particular the API makes it possible to use the
    objects in ooRexx.

    The subdirectories of this directory contain examples showing how to
    use the C++ API.

    Note that the extensions distributed with ooRexx make extensive use of
    the C++ API and provide a lot of code showing usage of the API.

    The subdirectories:

    call.example
    ------------
    This subdirectory has several examples of creating an interpreter
    instance.  One example uses the interpreter instance to call,
    execute, and obtain the result from Rexx programs.  The other
    dynamically creates a Rexx routine and calls that routine.
