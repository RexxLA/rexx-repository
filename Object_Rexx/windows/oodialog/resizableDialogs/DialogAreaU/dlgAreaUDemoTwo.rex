/**
 *  DlgAreaDemoTwo.Rex
 *
 *  Demonstrates a second approach to resizable dialogs.  Essentially what this
 *  approach does is to defer the redrawing of the dialog controls until the
 *  user has finished resizing the dialog.
 *
 *  By default, the DialogAreaU class calls a dialog method (the update method)
 *  that forces all the dialog controls to redraw themselves every time a resize
 *  event ocurrs.  This causes the constant flicker seen in DlgAreaDemo.rex.
 *
 *  The approach taken here is to tell the DialogAreaU object to *not* invoke
 *  the update method during the resize event.  This is done by setting the
 *  updateOnResize attribute to false in the DialogAreaU object.
 *
 *  Then we connect the size / move ended event to a method in our dialog.  This
 *  event is called exactly once when the user has stopped resizing or moving
 *  the dialog.
 *
 *  We keep track of whether the user is resizing, or not.  When we get the size
 *  move ended event, if the user was resizing, we invoke the redrawClient
 *  method of the dialog, forcing all the dialog controls to redraw themselves
 *  in their new, final, position.
 *
 *  This eliminates the flicker, but also makes it appear as though the dialog
 *  controls are not changing while the user is actively resizing.  When the
 *  user stops resizing, the dialog controls "magically" appear in their new
 *  size and position.
 *
 *  Which approach is better is probably a matter of personal preference.
 *
 *  After some use of this example program, a refinement to the above algorithm
 *  was made.  This is what is used now.  Since no repainting of the dialog
 *  controls is done until the last resize event, there is no sense in re-
 *  calculating the size and position of each control on every resize event.
 *
 *  Rather than invoke u~resize(self, sizeinfo) every single time in onResize()
 *  u~resize is only invoked when the dialog client area is going to be forced
 *  to redraw.
