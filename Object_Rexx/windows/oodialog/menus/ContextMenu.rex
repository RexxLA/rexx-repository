/* A demonstration of some of the Menu features in ooDialog.
 *
 * This example focuses on context menus.  Two different context menus are used
 * in this example, showing 2 different ways to create the context menus.  One
 * of the context menus is shown when the user right-clicks on the list view
 * control.  The other context menu is shown when the user right-clicks on any
 * other place on the dialog.  The first menu is specific to the list view, the
 * other menu is specific to the dialog.
 *
 * The list view menu is created by loading a menu from a resource script file.
 * Menus created from a resouce script are always menu bars.  In this example,
 * the menu bar is *not* attached to the dialog, rather it is simply used as the
 * source of the list view context menu.
 *
 * The second context menu is created dynamically using methods of the PopupMenu
 * class.

  srcDir = locate()

  -- When using symbolic IDs with menus, as this program does, the programmer
  -- *must* use the global constant directory, (.constDir,) rather than the
  -- constDir attribute of a dialog.  Menus are independent of dialogs.
  --
  -- The use of the global constant directory is controlled by the .Application
  -- object.  The .Application object is also used to set other application-wide
  -- defaults or values.  In this program, we also want to make the default for
  -- automatic data detection to be off.  Both of these requirements can be done
  -- with one method call to the .Application object.  As a convenience, the
  -- setDefaults() method will also populate the .constDir with symbols.
  --
  -- In this invokcation, the application is set to use the .constDir only, "O",
  -- symbols are loaded into the .constDir from the file: ContextMenu.h, and the
  -- default for automatic data detection is set to off (.false.)  Note that we
  -- create a complete path name for ContextMenu.h

  --
  -- You can create a menu completely indepedent of a dialog.  Note that at this
  -- point in the program, there is no dialog object at all.  Once created, the
  -- menu object can then be used where ever it is convenient.
  --
  -- The code for creating the list view menu is put in a separate function so
  -- that people can focus on only one thing at a time.  The function is at the
  -- end of this file.  In createListViewMenu(), the context menu is created
  -- dynamically and passed back to us.

  -- dialog.  For menu bars, the assigned dialog is the dialog the menu bar is
  -- attached to.  For pop up menus, the menu could be assigned to a dialog each
  -- time the context menu is shown.  But, it is usually more convenient to just
  -- assign the menu to a dialog one time.  That is what the assignTo() method
  -- does.
  --
  -- For the list view pop up menu, we connect each menu item to its own method.
  -- There are menu methods to connect individual menu items.  But there are
  -- also a number of convenience methods to connect a number of menu items at
  -- one time.
  --
  -- The second optional arguement in assignTo() turns on automatic menu item

  -- of a method to connect all the items to.  So, you can either connect each
  -- menu item to its own method, (omit the third argument,) or you can connect
  -- all menu items to one method.  When each menu item is connected to its own
  -- method, the method name is constructed by the ooDialog framework using the
  -- text of the menu item.
  --

 * ordinates are the position of the mouse, in pixels.  For the keyboard keys, x

 * right answer.  A normal thing to do here would be to place it at the selected
 * list view item.  Instead, I decided to place at the lower right corner of the
 * list view.  However, the list view has a vertical scroll bar which is within
 * the area of the list view and I didn't like the look of that.
 *
 * So, I decided to move it to the left of the scroll bar.  I still didn't like
 * that because of the shadowing, so I take that point and shift it up and over

 * created without any existing dialogs.  The object can then be used with any
