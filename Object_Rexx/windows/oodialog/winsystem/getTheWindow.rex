/**
 *   Name: getTheWindow.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  This example shows how to find a window without using the
 *                 exact window title.
 *
 *                 The WindowsManager class provides the find() method to get a
 *                 top-level window using its title.  But, you need to use the
 *                 exact title.  This example uses a method of the
 *                 WindowsManager, desktopWindow(), that is available in ooRexx
 *                 4.0.0 and later.  Once you get the desktop window, you can
 *                 enumerate all its children windows and compare their titles
 *                 in a custom matching function.
 *
