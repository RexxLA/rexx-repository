/**
 *   Name: writeWithNotepad.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  An example of using the winsystm.cls classes to control the
 *                 Notepad application.  It is a subset of the usewmgr.rex
 *                 example, intended to be simplier and maybe easier to see what
 *                 is happening.
 *
 *                 This example uses some of the public functions provided by
 *                 the windowsSystem.frm package. That framework contains
 *                 functions shared with other example programs shipped with
 *                 ooRexx that use winsystm.cls.
 *
 *   External function            Source
 *   ---------------------------------------------------
 *   getPathToSystemExe()         windowsSystem.frm
 *   errorDialog()                ooDialog
 *   findTheWindow()              windowsSystem.frm
 *   sendTextWithPause()          windowsSystem.frm
 *   sendKeyWithPause()           windowsSystem.frm
 *   isVistaOrLater()             windowsSystem.frm
 *   getWindowTree()              windowsSystem.frm
 *   showWindowTree()             windowsSystem.frm
 *   findDescendent()             windowsSystem.frm
 *
 * The external functions used by this program allow you to read through the
 * code here and get the over-all picture of how the program works.  To
 * understand the finer details, you will need to look at the implementation
 * of the external functions contained in windowsSystem.frm.

 * Vista has made this rather interesting.  With the Vista Notepad Save dialog,
