 *   Name: displayWindowTree.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  Allows the user to pick an open top-level window and then

 *                 uses both ooDialog and winsystm classes.
 *
 *                 This example uses some of the public functions provided by
 *                 the windowsSystem.frm package. That framework contains
 *                 functions shared with other example programs shipped with
 *                 ooRexx that use winsystm.cls.
