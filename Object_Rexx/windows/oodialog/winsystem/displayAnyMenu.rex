/**
 *   Name: displayAnyMenu.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  Displays the menu hierarchy for a window that the user picks.
 *
 *                 The user is prompted for the title of an open, top-level,
 *                 window.  This program then parses the details of the menubar
 *                 for that window and displays them graphically.
 *
 *                 The example uses a mixture of ooDialog and winsystm.
 *
 *                 In addition, the example uses some of the public functions
 *                 provided by the windowsSystem.frm package. That framweowork
 *                 is an example of how to extract common function into a
 *                 package and share that function with any number of ooRexx
 *                 programs.
 *
 *   The table below lists the external functions and classes used in this
 *   program and shows where to go to examine the source code for them.
