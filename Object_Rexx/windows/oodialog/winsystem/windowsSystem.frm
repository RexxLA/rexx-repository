/** findTheWindow()
 * Uses the WindowsManager to create a WindowObject representing a top-level
 * window currently running on the system.
 *
 * When an application is started up, it takes some finite amount of time before
 * the window for the application is created by the operating system.  The
 * WindowsManager can not 'find' the aplication window until it has been
 * created.  This function loops a number of times trying to find the window,
 * then eventually gives up
 *
 * How long to wait for to find the window before giving up can be adjusted by
 * the caller.
 *
 * @param   title  The title of the window being sought.
 * @param   loops  Optional.  The number of loops to perform looking for the
 *                 window.  The default is 20.
 * @param   pause  Optional.  The time to sleep during each loop.  The default
 *                 is .2 of a second.
 *
 * @return         A WindowObject object representing the desired window on
 *                 success.  If the function fails, .nil is returned.
 *
 * @note           To find a window, you must use its exact title.

 *
 * @note  Not to go into too much detail about the underlying implmentation of

 *        press to a window, a Windows API function is used that returns
 *        immediately, before the text or key press actually makes it to
 *        the OS window.  In a fast dual-core / multi-core / multi-processor
 *        system this can result in the window receiving the key presses or text
 *        in a different order than they are sent by ooRexx.
 *
 *        This function and the sendKeyWithPause() function prevent that out of
 *        ordering by pausing very slightly after doing the send.  This actually
 *        mimics more closely a user entering the data on a keyboard.  Anyone
 *        familiar with Expect, probably knows that Expect provides a similiar
