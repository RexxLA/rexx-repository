/**
 *   Name: menuNotepad.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  This example displays the hierarchy of the Notepad menu.
 *
 *                 The MenuObject class in winsystm.cls allows you to work with
 *                 the menus in a Windows window.  You can do things like
 *                 simulate a user selecting a menu item.  This in turn allows
 *                 you to 'remote control' a window.  However in order to
 *                 simulate selecting a menu item you need to know either its
 *                 text or its id.  These items can be difficult to learn
 *                 becuase often times a menu item's text has hidden characters
 *                 in it and the id of menu items are usually only known by the
 *                 application developer.
 *
 *                 This examle shows how to use the MenuObject to discover the
 *                 text and id numbers of any item in the Notepad menu.
 *
 *                 The example uses some of the public functions provided by
 *                 the windowsSystem.frm package. That framework contains
 *                 functions shared with other example programs shipped with
 *                 ooRexx that use winsystm.cls.
 *
 *                 This example does not have much comment.  To understand more
 *                 of the details of starting and closing Notepad automatically,
 *                 take a closer look at the writeWithNotepad.rex example.
 *
 *   External function            Source
 *   ---------------------------------------------------
 *   getPathToSystemExe()         windowsSystem.frm
 *   errorDialog()                ooDialog
 *   findTheWindow()              windowsSystem.frm
 *   MenuDetailer                 windowsSystem.frm
 *
 * The external functions used by this program allow you to read through the
 * code here and get the over-all picture of how the program works.  To
 * understand the finer details, you will need to look at the implementation
 * of the external functions contained in windowsSystem.frm.

-- To really understand how the MenuDetailer class works, take a look at its
-- implementation in windowsSystem.frm.

-- The MenuDetailer can either print or display the menu hierarchy.  Here we do
-- both.  print() shows the hierarchy on the console in text format.  display()
-- shows it in a graphical dialog.
