/* Some notes on how the event logging service works.  Typically, applications
   that want to write records to one of the event logs, add entries to the
   registry.  These registry entries control how the event logging service
   handles the writing of a record.

   The registry entries are written to subkeys under the Event log service.

   If an application has not added the registry entries, then the event records
   are *always* written to the Application log.  This can not be over-ridden.

   So, say there is an application, MyApplication that wants to write a record
   using the source name of MyApplication to an event log.  To do that the
   source name must be a subkey of a logfile entry under the EventLog key in the
   registry.

   If MyApplication should be written to the System log the registry key must
   be added like this:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   	  System
   	     CurrentControlSet
   	        Services
           	   EventLog
   	              System
   							     MyApplication
   	           Security
           	   System

   If the key does not exists, the Application event log is always used.
