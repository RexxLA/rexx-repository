/**
 *   Name: usewmgr.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  Demonstrates the use of the WindowsManager, the WindowObject,
 *                 and the WindowsClipboard classes.  Has some examples of
 *                 ooDialog usage.
 *
 *                 This example uses some of the public functions provided by
 *                 the windowsSystem.frm package. That framework contains
 *                 functions shared with other example programs shipped with
 *                 ooRexx that use winsystm.cls.
 *
 *   Note:         Because of language dependencies this example will not run
 *                 correctly on all language versions of Windows.  It assumes
 *                 the window titles are in English.  To run on a different
 *                 language version, change the window titles for the Calculator
 *                 and Notepad applications to the correct title for
 *                 the specific language version of Windows.
