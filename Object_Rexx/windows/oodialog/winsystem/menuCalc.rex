/**
 *   Name: menuCalc.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  Displays the menu hierarchy of the Windows Calculator
 *                 application.  The menu hierachy for both the Calculator's
 *                 standard view and its scientific view are printed to the
 *                 console.
 *
 *                 This is a very simple program so that it is easeier to see
 *                 the details.
 *
 *                 The example uses a mixture of ooDialog and winsystm.
 *
 *                 In addition, the example uses some of the public functions
 *                 provided by the windowsSystem.frm package. That framweowork
 *                 is an example of how to extract common function into a
 *                 package and share that function with any number of ooRexx
 *                 programs.
 *
 *   The below table lists the external functions and classes used in this
 *   program and shows where to go to examine the source code for them.

-- When the calculator program switches views, it actually creates a whole new
-- dialog window.  Because of that, if we do switch views we need to re-find the

-- The way we switch to Standard view is to simulator clicking on the View menu,

-- window object.  Then we tell the menu detailer object to 'print.'  Printing
-- sends the output to the console.

-- view is done as above, we simulate clicking on the Scientific menut item.

 *
 * But, it is always possible that getting a menu or submenu will fail and
