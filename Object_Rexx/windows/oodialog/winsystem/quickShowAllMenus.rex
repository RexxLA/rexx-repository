 *                 work once you have a created a package of useful functions.
 *
 *                 This program uses the windowsSystem.frm package to print out
 *                 a menu outline of every open window that has a menu.
 *
 *   The below table lists the external functions and classes used in this
 *   program and shows where to go to examine the source code for them.
