/**
 *   Name: menuCalc.rex
 *   Type: Example ooRexx program
 *
 *   Description:  Demonstrates how to control an application programmatically
 *                 using the winsystm classes.  Does some simple calculations
 *                 using the Windows Calculator application.
 *
 *                 This program is similar to userwmgr.rex but more simple to
 *                 better show what is going on.
 *
 *                 This example uses some of the public functions provided by
 *                 the windowsSystem.frm package.  That framweowork is an
 *                 example of how to extract common function into a package and
 *                 share that function with any number of ooRexx programs.
 *
 *   To really understand how this program works, you will need to examine the
 *   the code for the external functions in windowsSystem.frm.
 *
 *   The table below lists the external functions and classes used in this
 *   program and shows where to go to examine the source code for them.

/* Each button in a dialog has a resource ID.  When the button is pushed or
 * clicked, the button sends a command (WM_COMMAND) notification to its parent
 * window.  The command notification contains the resource ID of the button that
 * was pushed.  This is how the dialog knows what button(s) the user pushes or
 * clicks.
 *
 * We can simulate a user pushing buttons by sending commands to the dialog
 * using the resource ID of the button we want pushed.  Here we define variables
 * with the IDs of some of the buttons in the calculator application.  You can
 * verify that these are the correct ID numbers by exploring the window hiearchy
 * of the calculator application using the displayWindowTree.rex example program
 * that is included with the ooRexx distribution.
