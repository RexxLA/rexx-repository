  1.  ooDialog Example Programs
  -------------------------------

  This directory contains example ooDialog programs.  They are intended to
  be relatively short and simple programs that demonstrate how to use some
  feature of ooDialog.

    - addManyRows.rex

    This example's main purpose is to show how to use the ProgressDialog
    class.  It allows the user to select how many list-view items are to be
    added to the list-view before it starts.  It also does some interesting
    timings and displays the times in the dialog

    - browsePrinters.rex

    Shows how to use the BrowseForFolder class and how to customize the
    browse dialog so that the user can select a printer.

    - fileNameDialog_demo.rex

    The FileNameDialog public routine allows a programmer to present the
    user with the standard Windows Open or Save file dialog.  The
    fileNameDialog_demo program demonstrates how to use this routine.

    - imageButton.rex

    This example program demonstrates some of the new features introduced
    in ooRexx 4.0.0, including the .Image, .Imagelist classes, and the
    setImageList() method of the button class.

    - publicRoutines_demo.rex

    ooDialog contains a number of standard dialog and public routines.  The
    standard dialogs and public routines are designed to be easy to use.
    They allow a programmer to added simple graphical elements to a program
    without any detailed knowledge of the ooDialog framework.  The
    publicRoutines_demo program demonstrates how to use these public
    routines.

    - simpleFolderBrowse.rex

    Demonstrates how to use the SimpleFolderBrowse class to allow the user
    to pick a folder.

    - stopWatch.rex

    An intersting implmentation of a stop watch in Rexx.

    - useTools.rex

    This example program shows how to use a dialog that is an "owned"
    window.  Owned windows have several constraints, one of which is that
    they always remain above their owner window.  This makes them useful to
    create "tool palette" types of programs.  The example program does just
    that, demonstrates a main dialog with a tool palette.
