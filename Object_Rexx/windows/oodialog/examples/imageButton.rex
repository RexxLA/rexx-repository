/**
 * File:     imageButton.rex
 *
 * Category: ooDialog example
 *
 * Syntax:
 *   rc = imageButton
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Provides some example code of new ooDialog feature introduced in 4.0.0
 *
 *   This program uses a resource script (.rc) file for the dialog definition.
 *   The dialog was designed using a "what you see is what you get" dialog
 *   editor.  The resource script can be compiled into a binary image for use
 *   with a ResDialog.  In this case it is just left as a .rc file for use in
 *   a RcDialog.
 *
 *   Dialogs built using a dialog editor are much easier to create and maintain
 *   then UserDialogs.
 *
 * Input:
 *   None.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   0 on success, non-zero if the dialog could not be created for some reason.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   This is a short program written to amuse my niece.  Two of the button
 *   controls in the dialog use an image list.  The text for the buttons is 'Add
 *   Pictures' and 'View Pictures' with a picture of a camera on them.  When the
 *   user moves the mouse pointer over either one of the buttons, the picture
 *   changes to a skull and the text changes to 'Death if you touch me.' When
 *   the user pushes either of the buttons the picture changes to a giant bee.
 *
 *   My niece and I think this is hilarious.
 *
 *   The dialog shows how to use a button control image list.  Since I am not
 *   artistic, I produced the images by cutting them out of digital pictures
 *   I have taken over the last few years.
 *
 *   A professional application would of course use professional graphics.  This
 *   dialog just gives an idea of what the button control can do with an image
 *   list.

/* When you are done using an image list you can release it to free up system
 * resources.
 *
 * Please note that when this program ends, the process will disappear and the
 * OS will free up the resources automatically.
 *
 * As noted in a comment above, if you release the image list when it is in
 * use, the pictures disappear.  Testing has shown that releasing an image list
 * when it is in use, does not crash the system.  However, releasing an image
 * list while it is in use would seem to be a foolish practice.
 *
 * When would you want to release an image list?  In this case if this dialog
 * was a part of a bigger, long running application.  When this dialog ends, it
 * makes sense to free up the system resources used for the image list.  Since
 * the main application is still running, the OS will not release the resources
 * used in this dialog.
 *
 * Microsoft says, you should release an image list when you are done with it.
 *
 * In this case that would be when the dialog is closed.  There are at least 2
 * strategies that could be employed.
 *
 * 1.) Save a reference to the image list handle returned by .ImageList~create()
 * and pass it to release().
 *
 * 2.) Use getImageList() to ask the button to give you the image list
 * information and use the image list object that is returned as part of the
 * .Directory object.  The image list object in strategy 1 and 2 are the same
 * object.
 *
 * Don't forget to release the handle if either the dialog is canceled or if it
 * is closed.  Below is a demonstration of both strategies.
