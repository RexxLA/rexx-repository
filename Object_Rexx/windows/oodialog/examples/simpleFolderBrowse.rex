/**
 * A quick example of the SimpleFolderBrowse class.  This class only has one
 * method: getFolder() and it is a class method.
 *
 * It is very easy to use, you just invoke the getFolder() method and the folder
 * picked by the user is returned.  When the user picks a folder the fully
 * qualified path name is returned.  If the user cancels, the empty string is
 * returned.
 *
 * It is possible, depending on how the dialog is set up, for the user to pick a
 * virtual folder that has no file system path.  In that case, .nil is returned.
