/** saveFileWithFilter.rex
 *
 *  This example shows how to use the Common Item Dialog in file save mode.
 *
 *  This example will only run on Vista or later.
 *
 *  Both the .OpenFileDialog and the .SaveFileDialog are subclasses of the
 *  .CommonItemDialog class.  The Rexx programmer can not instantiate a
 *  .CommonItemDialog object.  Instead the programmer picks the type of file
 *  dialog he wants, a save file or an open file dialog and instantitates that
 *  class.  Almost all of the methods for these classes come from the
 *  CommonItemDialog class and are documented in the reference manual under the
 *  CommonItemDialog section.
 *
 *  This example shows 2 things.  1.) How to use a filter with the dialog.  This
 *  is done with the .ShellItemFilter class.  2.) How to connect event
 *  notifications.  This is done with the .CommonDialogEvents class.
 *
 *  For the purpose of the example, we use a hypothetical case that the
 *  application wants the user to pick a file to save to, but the data being
 *  saved can not be saved to file with the extension of .exe, or .dll, or .cls.
 *
 *  To achieve this a filter is used so that the save dialog does not show any
 *  files with those extensions.  To ensure the user does not type in a file
 *  name with those extensions, when the user picks a file name, the OnFileOk
 *  event is used to check the file name the user picked.
 *
 *  To give the example a little variety, a dialog is first put up to allow the
 *  user to pick some or all of the extensions to filter out and the Save File
 *  Dialog can be shown multiple times.
 *
 *  The Common Item Dialog allows its state to be saved on a per instance basis
 *  in addition to the per process basis.  This is done by generating a GUID and
 *  assigning it to the dialog before it is configured.  Then, for each dialog
 *  with the same GUID, the operating system saves its state separately.
 *
 *  To make use of this feature, the programmer would generate a single GUID and
 *  then assign the same GUID each time the file dialog was shown in the
 *  application.
 *
 *  This simple program can be used to generate a GUID.  Run the program and
 *  then copy and paste the output on the command line in to your program.
 *
 * - - - - - - - - - Cut begin - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

/** onShowSaveDialog()
 *
 * When the user clicks on the 'Show Save File Dialog' push button, we put up
 * the Save File Dialog and then report the results in the edit control.
 *
 * The Save File Dialog filters out files in the view of the dialog.  The
 * checked check boxes determine which files are filtered out, or no files are
 * filtered out.
 *
 * Say the .exe and .dll extensions are set (through the check boxes) to be
 * filtered out.
 *
 * To filter out those values in the view of the dialog, we need to instantiate
 * a .ShellItemFilter object.  The ShellItemFilter has just one method:
 * includeItem().  The operating system's Save File Dialog will invoke that
 * method for each file in the initial folder.  When / if the user changes to a
 * new folder, the operating system again invokes the method for each file in
 * the new folder.  If the method returns S_OK the file is included, if S_FALSE
 * is returned, the file is not shown in the view.
 *
 * The includeItem() of the .ShellItemFilter class simply returns S_OK.  To
 * change that behavior the Rexx programmer creates a subclass and over-rides
 * the includeItem() method.
 *
 * However, the user could simply type in the name: myfile.exe in the edit box.
 * We also want to prevent that.  To do this we need to instantiate a
 * .CommonDialogEvents object.  The .CommonDialogEvents class has a method for
 * every notification the operating system's common item dialog sends.  These
 * methods all simply return the proper value to continue.  To change the
 * default behaviour the Rexx programmer creates a subclass and over-rides the
 * methods she is interested in.
