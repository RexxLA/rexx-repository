/** Owned window example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to make a dialog window owned by another dialog
 * window.  It simulates a tool palette, which is owned by the main dialog.
 *
 * Windows that are owned by another window have several constraints.  The owned
 * window is always above its owner window.  If the owner window is minimized,
 * the owned window is hidden.  When the owner window is destroyed, its owned
 * windows are also destroyed.
 *
 * The programmer creates an owned window by setting its ownerDialog attribute
 * to the owner window.  Once set, the owner window can not be changed.  The
 * ownerDialog attribute can not be set once the Windows dialog of the owned
 * windows has been created.  The underlying Windows dialog of the owner window
 * must be created before the underlying Windows dialog of the owned window is
 * created.  However, the owner Windows dialog does not have to be created yet
 * when it is assigned to the owned window.
 *
 * The owned dialog always behaves as if it were executed using the popupAsChild
 * method.  That is, it is a modeless dialog that operates indepenedently of its
 * owner dialog and it is destroyed when its owner (parent) dialog is destroyed.
 * But, the programmer does not have to use the popupAsChild method to execute
 * the owned dialog, the programmer can use any of the methods that start the
 * underlying Windows dialog.
