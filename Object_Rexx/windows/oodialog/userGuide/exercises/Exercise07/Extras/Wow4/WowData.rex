    getRecord - asks super to read the file from disk.
                Normally for a 'named' component, MVF invokes 'getRecord'
                to ask the Data component for a single record (handled by the
                'GenericFile' superclass). For a ListModel, MVF invokes 'getFile'
                to get the whole file to display in a list.
                Here, although WowModel is a Model, not a ListModel, we want the
                whole file. And GenericFile holds the file in its 'fileAsDirectory'
                attribute. So we intercept the 'getRecord' message, and return
                the file.
