  1.  Simple ooDialog Example Programs
  ------------------------------------

  This directory contains example ooDialog programs that are intended to be
  simple enough to not require any comment.  They are short and only
  demonstrate a few things.  They should encourage the user to read the
  ooDialog documentation to better understand the areas the programs are
  concerned with.

    - SimpleUpDown.rex

    Shows how to create an up down control in a user dialog and initialize
    it.

    - ChangeFont.rex

    Shows how to create a new font correctly and how to change the font of
    a dialog control using the created font.  It is also an example of a
    multi-line edit control and shows how to enable and disable buttons.

    - SimpleMonthCalendar.rex

    Shows how to use a month calendar control in a rc dialog and how to
    respond to selected date changes.
