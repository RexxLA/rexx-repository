/**
 *  There are 3 types of combo boxes: simple, drop down, and drop down list.
 *  This example shows a dialog with 3 combo boxes, one of each kind.  It is
 *  mostly meant to show the difference in the 3 types to allow an ooDialog
 *  programmer to pick the type to use for a program.
 *
 *  One thing about combo boxes is that a combo box is not a single control.  It
 *  is a mix of several controls, an edit control and a listbox and a button.
 *  Because of this, the normal setColor() method does not work well for the
 *  programmer that wants to set the color of dialog controls.  For the combo
 *  box, ooDialog provides the setFullColor() method which sets the color for
 *  the entire combo box.  This example also demonstrates that method, along
 *  with the removeFullColor() method.
