/** toolBar.rex
 *
 * Very simple ToolBar example.  Just does the very minimum to show a tool bar.
 *
 * Note that most dialog editors do not have an option to add a tool bar.  This
 * can be overcome by editing the .rc file and manually adding the tool bar
 * control.  Which was done for this example.
 *
 * MSDN says that with some of the tool bar functionality there can be problems
 * painting the tool bar.  The suggestion is to create the tool bar not visible
 * and then show the tool bar after it has been set up.  That is what is done in
 * this example.
