/**
 *  This example shows how to work with a simple ListView control in report
 *  view.
 *
 *  The main points of the example are:
 *
 *  1.) It shows how to use the LvFullRow, LvItem, and LvSubItem objects to add
 *      items to list-views
 *
 *  2.) It shows how to use custom draw with a list-view change the text and
 *      background color of a single list-view item, and / or change the font
 *      for a single item.
 *
 *  Note that in the .rc file, the resource script file, for this example, the
 *  dialog is created *not* visible.  Thus, while the dialog is being
 *  initialized, it is not visible on the screen.  This eliminates flicker while
 *  the items are being inserted into the list-view.  Some people like the users
 *  of their applications to see the list-view being filled, some people dislike
 *  flicker.  So, it is mostly a matter of preference how you create the dialog,
 *  initially visible, or initially invisible.  But, it is good to be aware of
 *  the option.

 *
 * 1.) You must init the custom draw interface before invoking any of the custom
 * draw methods.  This is done by invoking the customDraw() method.
 *
 * 2.) You name the control you want the custom draw notifications for by
 * invoking the forControl() method with: the resource ID of the control, the

 * At this time, only ListView controls are supported.  Future versions of

 * Note that we created the colors and font one time here, rather than create
 * them each time the onCustomDraw() method is invoked.
 *
 * We also create our LvFullRows objects here rather than in initDialog().  This
 * helps allow the dialog to open with everything appearing at once.  The full

 *
 * You can change the text color, the background color, and the font by setting
 * those attributes of the LvCustomDrawSimple object.  You also need to set the
 * reply attribute.  This attribute is the reply sent back to the list-view.

 * For this example, we return CDRF_NEWFONT to tell the list-view that either
 * colors, or fonts, were changed and that we do not want to recieve subitem
 * notifications.  Other possible replies are not discussed here as they are not
 * pertinent to this example.  The ooDialog documentation describes the other
 * possible replies.

 * The logic of what we are doing is relatively simple.  We color every other
 * row with a different color, if the user has not checked the row.  All checked
