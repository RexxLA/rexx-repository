/**
 *  A simple List View control using ooDialog.  Demonstrates how to determine
 *  which column within a row the user has clicked on.
 *
 *  Note that you must add the FULLROWSELECT extended style to the list view in
 *  order to get the correct row number.  If the list view does not have this
 *  style, Windows only reports the row number if the text label in the left-
 *  most column is clicked on.
 *
 *  Each time the user clicks on the list view control, the row and column
 *  clicked are reported.  This is done using "say" so the program is best
 *  run from a command prompt window.
