/**
 *  This example shows how to embedd a drop down list combo box in a list-view,
 *  to allow the user to edit the subitems in the list-view.
 *
 *  To activate the editing, the user clicks once on a subitem, then clicks one
 *  more time to activate the editing.  A drop down list combo box takes the
 *  place of the subitem in the list-view.  With a drop down list combo box the
 *  user can only select an item from the list.
 *
 *  When the user is in the editing mode, hitting enter, escape, or clicking the
 *  mouse any where else on the scren, ends the editing.  If enter is hit, the
 *  changes are accepted, otherwise, the changes are abandoned.
 *
 *  The key to how this works is creating an invisible combo box, which is then
 *  made a child of the list-view.  When editing mode is entered, the combo box
 *  positioned over the subitem, sized to the size of the subitem, and made
 *  visible.  When editing is over, the combo box is made invisible again.
 *
 *  The Rexx combo box, after it is made a child of the list-view, can be used
 *  as normal, with one caveat: Since it is a child of the list-view, the combo
 *  box no longer sends its event nofications to the dialog.  They are sent to
 *  the list-view.  This means that connecting the combo box events will have no
 *  effect.
