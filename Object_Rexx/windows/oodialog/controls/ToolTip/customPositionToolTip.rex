/**
 * ToolTip control example.
 *
 * This example demonstrates use info tips with a tree-view and do custom
 * positiong of the tool tip.
 *
 * The appearance and functionality of the dialog in this example is exactly the
 * same as that produced by the manageControlTool.rex example.  It simple shows
 * an easier way to achieve the same effect as that example.
 *
 * Here we use a simple application of the manageAtypicalTool() method.  The
 * manageControlTool.rex example is provided to better help the ooDialog
 * programmer understand the manageAtypicalTool() method.  The programmer should
 * really examine both example programs.
 *
 * To customize the positioning of the info tip, we need to write an event
 * handler for the ToolTips SHOW event.  However, the ToolTip for the tree-views
 * info tips is owned by the tree-view.  Event notifications are sent to the
 * tree-view and our dialog has no knowledge of them.
 *
 * To fix that, we use the getToolTips() method to get the tree-views ToolTip.
 * We then use the manageAtypicalTool() method to monitor the event
 * notifications sent to the tree-view and send the SHOW notification to our
 * dialog instead of to the tree-view.  All other events, including the mouse
 * relay event, are left to go to the tree-view.  This gives us the same
 * functionality as the custom ToolTip that is set up in the manageControlToo
 * example, with less work.

 * for and the user data (item data) for that item.  We set the item data for
 * each item to the text to display for the ToolTip for that item.  Which makes
 * this very easy.  We just return the userData sent to us.
 *
 * Note this also.  Our onShow() event handler is invoked by our monitoring of
 * the ToolTip notifications.  That monitor has no knowledge of which item the
 * ToolTip is going to be displayed for.  So, we use the exposed currentItem
 * variable to pass on our knowledge here of which item the ToolTip is going to

 * and obscures the other items.  What we want is to place the ToolTip window to
 * the right and centered with the item.  This way nothing is obscured.
 *
 * The custom positioning of the ToolTip window is straight-forward.  We get the
 * bounding rectangle of the tree-view item's label, convert the point to client
 * coordinates, and then reposition the ToolTip window to where we want it.

 * Note that we must return .true then so that the ToolTip is informed not to
