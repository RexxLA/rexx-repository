/**
 * An example of a date and time picker control and how to handle the USERSTRING
 * event notification.
 *
 * This program mimics an application that could be used to change the system
 * date and time.  It allows the user to enter a new system date and or time
 * through a DTP control.  Once a new date and / or new time are displayed in
 * the DTP control, if the user clicks the ok button the system date and time
 * is updated to the date and time displayed in the control.
 *
 * When a DTP control has the CANPARSE style, it allows the user to directly
 * enter text in the display area of the DTP.  When the user is done editing,
 * a USERSTRING event notification is sent.  The programmer connects this event
 * and then handles the notification by updating the DTP control based on the
 * text the user entered.
 *
 * This program allows the user to directly enter what are termed 'shortcut'
 * strings.
 *
 * When the program starts, the DTP control is set to the current system date
 * and time.  Of course as the dialog executes the system time is advancing.  If
 * the user has changed the DTP to a new date and / or time, but then wants to
 * undo those changes, it would be difficult to manually set the DTP control to
 * the current system date and time.  So that operation is one set of shortcuts.
 *
 * The other set of shortcuts allows the user to directly go to some time or
 * date by just typing it in.  For instance, if the user wanted to change the
 * date to May 12, 2050, rather than page through the DTP control to get there,
 * the user can just type 5/12/2050 directly in the DTP control.
 *
 * To directly type in the DTP control, the user can either use the F2 key, or
 * mouse click on the DTP control's display area when the DTP currently has the
 * focus.  This is a (little known?) feature of the DTP control itself.  It is
 * not something that the ooDialog framework provides.
 *
 * The valid shortcuts are these:
 *
 * Reset shortcut:
 *
 *   This shortcut resets any changes to the date and or time to none.  It also
 *   resets the date and time picker control to the current systeme date and
 *   time.
 *
 *   Type 'reset', 'cancel' 'r', or 'c'  Case is not significant.
 *
 * New date and or new time shortcut:
 *
 *   This shortcut allows directly entering a new date, or a new time, or both.
 *
 *   Formats for new date:  mm/dd, or mm/dd/yyyy
 *
 *   Formats for new time:  hh:mm, or hh:mm:ss
 *
 *   When both date and time are entered, the date must precede the time. The
 *   date and time must be separated by one or more spaces.  It is not required
 *   to enter a date and a time.  Only a new date can be entered or only a new
 *   time.
 *
 *   Months (mm), days (dd), hours (hh), minutes (mm), or seconds(ss) can
 *   contain a leading 0, but are not required to.  I.e., for June 5th, the new
 *   date string can be 06/05, 6/05, 06/5, or 6/5.  The year (yyyy) portion of
 *   the new date string is required to be the 4 digit year.  I.e. 6/5/11 is not
 *   valid for June 5th 2011.

 *

 *
 * This is the main point of this example, to show how to handle the user string
 * event.  We examine what the user typed and determine if it is a valid
 * 'shortcut' string.  When it is valid, we return a .DateTime object with the
 * date and time we want the DTP control to update its display to.  If it is not
 * valid we return the same .DateTime object we received.

 * When the returned date and time is different from the DTP control's current
 * date an it, the control updates its display to the returned date and time.
 * When the returned date and time is the same as the DTP controls current date
 * and time, the DTP does nothing.
 *
 * When users type a shortcut string, they will expect the DTP control's display
 * to change.  However, typos are common.  Without a clue as to what they did
 * wrong, it is hard for users to know what happened.  So, it the user string is
 * not valid, we display a clue to the problem by setting the IDC_ST_INVALID
 * static control's text to an error message.
 *
 * Other than those basic principles, it is merely a matter of determining if
 * the user typed a valid shortcut, or not.
