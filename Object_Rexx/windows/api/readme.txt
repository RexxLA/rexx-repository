Open Object Rexx API samples

This is the read me for the three API samples, callrxwn, callrxnt, and
rexxexit.  Each sample is installed in its own directory. The wpipe samples
have their own read me file in the wpipe directory.

The following notes on compiling the samples also apply to the wpipe samples.

Make files, which are compatible with nmake, are included in each sample
directory so that you can rebuild the samples.  In order to use the make files
to build the samples, you must set up the environment variables INCLUDE and
LIB.

Compilation:
------------
The environment variable INCLUDE must contain the path to rexx.h as well as
the regular compiler include paths.  The rexx.h file is located in the top
level api\ directory of the ooRexx installation.

Linking:
--------
The environment variable LIB must contain the path to rexx.lib and rexxapi.lib
as well as the regular compiler library paths.  These library files are
included in the same location as rexx.h, that is, in the top level api\
directory of the ooRexx installation.

Samples:
--------

callrxwn   - Windows mode application

           - Provides a sample call to the REXX interpreter, passing
             in an environment name, a file name, and a single argument
             string. A dialog box is created for the output.

           - Note that you must define a REXX standard input and
             output exit handler for a Windows mode application.
             This is not necessary for Console mode applications, however.


callrxnt   - Console mode application

           - Has similar functionality to callrxwn

           - Console mode applications calling Object REXX do not
             require input and output exit handlers.

rexxexit   - Console mode application

           - Provides a sample call to the REXX interpreter, passing
             in arguments from the command line. A REXX input and
             output exit handler is also demonstrated.

           - An example input file, testRexxExit is provided.  Using that file
             an invocation of rexxexit.exe would look like:

             rexxexit testRexxExit "18 9"

             The two numbers need to be in quotes because rexxexit no more
             than two arguments, the input file name and a single argument for
             the input file.

The API samples in the directories WPIPE1, WPIPE2, WPIPE3 demonstrate:

- How to register external functions from within external functions

- How you can provide external functions (written in C) in a dynamic link
  library that can be accessed from Open Object Rexx (after they have been
  registered)

- How data can be returned from external functions.

- How the REXX Variable Pool Interface can be used to access and modify Open
  Object Rexx variables

WPIPE1
======
Start: "REXX APITEST1"
Description: Registers a number of functions that produce some screen output or
             return some data.

WPIPE2
======
Start: "REXX APITEST2"
Description: Sets the value of a variable by using the REXX Variable Pool
             Interface

WPIPE3
======
Start: "REXX APITEST3"
Description: Demonstrates a more extensive use of the REXX Variable Pool
             Interface

Rexx Application Programming Intefaces" in the Open Object Rexx Programming
Guide.
