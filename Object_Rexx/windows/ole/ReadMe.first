                          OLE Object Examples
                          ===================

    This directory and its subdirectories contain a number of example
    programs that use the OleObject class.

    There are two other nice example programs that combine using the
    OleObject class and the ooDialog framework.  Those programs are
    included in the ooDialog examples in the following directories:

    samples\oodialog\oleinfo

    and

    samples\oodialog\sysinfo
