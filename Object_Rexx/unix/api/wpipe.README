The API samples in the directories WPIPE1, WPIPE2, WPIPE3 demonstrate how to:

- Register external functions from within external functions
- How you can provide external functions (written in C) in a library that can
  be accessed from Open Object Rexx (after they have been registered)
- How data can be returned from external functions
- How the REXX Variable Pool Interface can be used to access and modify Open
  Object Rexx variables

WPIPE1
======
Start: "REXX APITEST1"
Description: This sample registers a few functions that produce some screen output or
             return some data

WPIPE2
======
Start: "REXX APITEST2"
Description: Sets the value of a variable by using the Rexx Variable Pool Interface


WPIPE3
======
Start: "REXX APITEST3"
Description: A more extensive use of the Rexx Variable Pool Interface


For more information about the Open Object Rexx API read Appendix A in the
Open Object Rexx Programming Guide.
